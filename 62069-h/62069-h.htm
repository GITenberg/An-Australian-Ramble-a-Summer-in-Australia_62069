<p class="gutsumm">The <i>Orizaba</i>&mdash;Reasons for
Travelling&mdash;The Bishop&mdash;Soda and Whisky&mdash;The
Spanish Coast&mdash;Heroic
Memories&mdash;Gibraltar&mdash;Wickedness of Naples&mdash;Port
Said.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">send</span> this from the
<i>Orizaba</i>, one of the finest, if not the finest, of the fine
steamers of the Orient Line that keep open the communication
between this country and Australia; and this is how it came to
pass.&nbsp; One day last summer I was standing on the deck of a
steamer, when a gentleman remarked to me, &lsquo;I come from a
country where they have had no rain for nine months.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where is that?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Australia,&rsquo; was the reply; and immediately I made up
my mind to go there.&nbsp; As is the custom of most of us, I
talked <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>the
matter over with my friends, some of them in the first rank of
the medical world.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t do better,&rsquo;
was the unanimous reply; &lsquo;you will come back ten years
younger,&rsquo; said they all.&nbsp; Well, surely it is worth
taking a little trouble and incurring a little expense, for a
man&mdash;not to put too fine a point on it&mdash;presenting
daily a more venerable appearance, to put back the clock, as it
were, and to regain somewhat of his manly prime.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What can I do for you?&rsquo; said the family doctor to
the mother of the Rothschilds, when he was summoned to her side;
&lsquo;I cannot make you grow young again.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; was her ladyship&rsquo;s reply; &lsquo;I know
you can&rsquo;t, doctor; but I wish to continue to grow
old.&rsquo;&nbsp; And here, just by taking a trip to Australia,
and escaping the hardships of an English winter and spring,
actually I shall achieve what the mother of the Rothschilds did
not dare to hope for.&nbsp; Surely the attempt is worth an
effort, especially when, owing to the kindness of a certain firm
of publishers who shall be nameless, the question of expense was
satisfactorily solved.</p>
<p>In these days of school-boards and universal travel a good
deal has yet to be learned of our colonies.&nbsp; When I was
younger, people in this country were in the most ludicrous state
of ignorance as respects the size, area, wealth and value of what
it is now <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>the fashion to term the fifth quarter of the globe.&nbsp;
At that time, say about 1830, there were not much more than
70,000 in all the land.&nbsp; Then Sydney Smith was writing of it
as a region &lsquo;in which Nature has been so capricious, that
she makes cherries with the stones on the outside, and a
monstrous animal, as tall as a grenadier, with the head of a
rabbit and a tail as big as a bedpost, hopping along at the rate
of five hops to a mile.&rsquo;&nbsp; Listen to Charles Lamb, as
he writes, in his &lsquo;Essays of Elia,&rsquo; to a friend in
New South Wales: &lsquo;What must you be willing by this time to
give for the sight of an honest man?&nbsp; You must have
forgotten how <i>we</i> look.&nbsp; Do you grow your own
hemp?&nbsp; What is your staple trade&mdash;exclusive of the
national profession, I mean?&nbsp; Your locksmiths, I take it,
are some of your great capitalists.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was at that
time the popular belief was embodied by Tom Hood as follows in
&lsquo;A Letter from a Settler for Life in Van Diemen&rsquo;s
Land,&rsquo; wherein Susan Gale writes to her old friend and
fellow-servant in Mount Street, Grosvenor Square: &lsquo;As soon
as ever the Botes rode to Land I don&rsquo;t aggrivate the Truth
to say their was half duzzen Bows apiece to Hand us out to shoar;
and sum go so far as to say they was offered to through Speeking
Trumpits afore they left the Ship-side.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is
still a legend of a Missionary Society <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>at home sending out a representative
to Australia, and so carefully planning his route that he was to
preach at Adelaide on the Sunday morning, and at Melbourne, some
hundreds of miles away, in the afternoon, and that was before
they had a railway.&nbsp; There are many who still think that a
colony is a place where men are fortunate, as a late colonial
governor remarked, if they enjoy three meals a day and a place to
sleep in, where the inhabitants sit down to dinner in their
shirt-sleeves, and think it a hardship if they take off their
boots when they go to bed.&nbsp; But the greatest fallacy of all
is the supposition that in a colony anyone can get a living, no
matter how incompetent he may have proved himself at home.&nbsp;
We laugh, but are we much wiser now?&nbsp; In Fleet Street last
week, as I bade good-bye to a friend, he said to me, &lsquo;I
have a boy who will be coming home just as you land.&nbsp; I sent
him out with the best introductions.&nbsp; He has been six months
in Melbourne and Sydney and elsewhere, and can find nothing to
do, and now I have to get him home again.&rsquo;&nbsp; It will be
something if, in the course of my letters, and as the result of
my inquiries, I shall be able to save fathers and mothers at home
the trouble and expense and pain of such fruitless ventures, and
it will be better still if I can help men and women at home to
understand and <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>realize what is being done by our fellow-subjects on the
Australian Continent to plant that great land with Anglo-Saxon
civilization and freedom and religion&mdash;if I can duly
describe its cities and their people, their wealth and
intelligence, their general activity and enterprise, their inner
and public life.&nbsp; According to all accounts a good deal is
yet to be told.&nbsp; Even Mr. Froude has omitted much that would
interest the reader, and Dr. Dale has left something for the
individual who may chance to follow in his steps.&nbsp; The fact
is, the subject is too big for any one man.</p>
<p>I have said I send this from the <i>Orizaba</i>, one of the
finest, if not the finest steamer of the Orient Line.&nbsp; Then
there are the P. and O., who do not carry third-class passengers,
and French and German steamers in abundance, to say nothing of
other firms, who are always sending out steamers and
sailing-vessels as well.&nbsp; As regards the latter, the firm of
Devitt and Moore, of Fenchurch Street, deserve special mention,
as they are the oldest people in the trade.&nbsp; Tourists who
have the time to spare say there is nothing like a sailing-vessel
for an Australian trip, and of the ships that sail in that
direction, from all I hear, there are none that can equal the
<i>Sobraon</i> (Captain Elmslie), and the <i>Macquarie</i>, in
the Sydney <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>trade (Captain Goddard, late of the
<i>Paramatta</i>).&nbsp; All the fleet of this firm, however,
bear a high character, and passengers, whether as regards
accommodation or the commissariat, have no occasion to
complain.&nbsp; The special objects of the managers of the Orient
Company are to increase the facilities for the interchange of
communication, and to promote the speed, safety, and, it may be
added, pleasure of the passage.&nbsp; They are under contract
with the Governments of New South Wales and South Australia to
convey the mails fortnightly between England and Australia by way
of Suez, and also run occasional steamers by the Cape of Good
Hope.&nbsp; Since the Line was opened in 1877, upwards of 150,000
passengers have been carried to and fro, with all but total
immunity from accident to life or limb.&nbsp; It cannot be
doubted that the facilities thus afforded have added alike to the
welfare and happiness of both the old world and the new.&nbsp; At
home we are supplied with Australian produce, and Australia is a
good customer in the English market.&nbsp; The service is
performed by some eleven first-class steamers, varying from 3,000
to 7,000 tons.&nbsp; An old stager gave me the hint to choose one
of the smaller vessels, on the plea that I should have better
attendance on board.&nbsp; However, I prefer to follow the crowd,
and <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>have
secured my berth on board the <i>Orizaba</i>, named after one of
the highest mountains, somewhere, they tell me, in South
America.&nbsp; Already she has carried the largest number of
passengers ever taken by one vessel to Australia.&nbsp; She was
built and engined by the Barrow Shipbuilding Company, the
builders of the far-famed <i>City of Rome</i>.&nbsp; In the
saloon there are chairs for 130 first-class passengers.&nbsp; The
ship&rsquo;s company numbers 200.&nbsp; There are second-class
and third-class passengers on board.&nbsp; Apparently there is
little danger of starvation, as the provision-chambers of the
ship are sufficient to supply fresh provisions for 1,000 persons
from England to Australia.&nbsp; The promenade deck is grand; and
as to the saloons and drawing-rooms, they are fitted up in
palatial style, and the electric light by night makes the
interior look like fairyland.&nbsp; I ought to be happy with all
the provision made for comfort on board.&nbsp; But who can say
what may happen when I am in the Bay of Biscay, or even after I
have set foot on <i>terra firma</i>?&nbsp; Strange things are
constantly occurring.&nbsp; The other day I heard of a good man
in Essex, in one of its small towns, who, as duty required, went
to his favourite chapel on the Sunday morning; on his return to
his Sunday dinner he was rather astonished to find that in his
temporary absence his wife and <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>daughters had packed up and started to
join the Mormons on the other side of the Atlantic.&nbsp; It is
to be hoped that no such calamity may happen to me.&nbsp; As to
myself, there is little danger of my doing anything rash, for
&lsquo;he that hath wife and children hath given hostages to
fortune,&rsquo; as the great Lord Bacon told the world long
ago.</p>
<p>It was not till Sunday morning that we left Plymouth, instead
of Saturday.&nbsp; The fact was we had a tremendous addition in
the shape of passengers and luggage to take on board, as all the
people from the North come <i>vi&acirc;</i> Plymouth, besides the
London passengers who are glad to escape the dangers of the
Channel.&nbsp; On Sunday morning we had a short service in what
is termed the drawing-room.&nbsp; The bishop, of course, was a
colonial (you never go to sea without meeting one), and wore his
official robes, though his reading-desk was but a small table,
which was covered by the British flag.&nbsp; The bishop followed
up the prayers with a five minutes&rsquo; address, in which he
said that a ship was like the world.&nbsp; In the world we were
exposed to temptation, and so it was on board a ship.&nbsp; We
were exposed to temptations from our fellow-passengers&mdash;an
unkind reflection on some of us, I thought.&nbsp; Asking the
purser what, from his wide experience of life on a ship, the
peculiar form of <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>temptation to which we were exposed was, his reply was
&lsquo;whisky and soda&rsquo;&mdash;a form of temptation of
which, apparently, the bishop had nothing to say.&nbsp; The
bishop does not interest me greatly, though he has kindly
volunteered to read prayers every morning.&nbsp; The air of the
bishop&rsquo;s lady is slightly subdued, as if the weight of her
dignity were too much; <i>she</i> reads Church papers, whilst
<i>he</i> evidently enjoys his novel.</p>
<p>But let me leave the bishop alone, and turn to things of a
more worldly character.&nbsp; Poor Edgar Poe writes: &lsquo;There
are four conditions of happiness in life, and one of them is life
in the open air.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this respect we are especially
fortunate.&nbsp; We are no sooner out of the Devonshire mists
than we are in the Bay of Biscay, calm as an infant on its
mother&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; We live in the open air.&nbsp;
Passed Cape Finisterre after dark on Monday night, and steamed
pleasantly down the Spanish coast, having an especially fine view
of Cintra and the mouth of the Tagus.&nbsp; All along the coast
were dotted, amongst the foliage, white villages, and towns, and
villas, all basking in the summer sun.&nbsp; Heroic memories come
to us as we pass over the seas where the <i>Captain</i> was lost,
in consequence, it is to be feared, of defective seamanship, with
her crew of picked men and some of our finest lads of noble
birth.&nbsp; All along that coast, when Old <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>England was
fighting for pre-eminence and power, and on those far-away hills
has the noise of battle rolled, and not in vain, for the struggle
that ended with Waterloo placed England in the first rank among
the nations of the earth.&nbsp; From Tilbury&rsquo;s ancient fort
to Gibraltar we are reminded how England, with her wooden walls
and hardy sons, proudly swept the seas, and was a terror to the
despots and a deliverer of the slave.&nbsp; Plymouth especially
calls up a host of glorious names, as we think of Drake, and
Hawkins, and Frobisher, and the Pilgrim Fathers.&nbsp; It was
from Plymouth that Cook and Vancouver sailed, to give us New
South Wales in the East and British Columbia in the West.&nbsp;
As soon as we cross the Bay of Biscay we think of Corunna and Sir
John Moore.&nbsp; Afar off are the heights of Torres Vedras,
celebrated in the Peninsular War.&nbsp; Cape St. Vincent, a bluff
260 feet high, having a convent, on which is the lighthouse,
reminds us of the brilliant victory won by Sir John Jervis, with
Nelson and Collingwood fighting under his flag; and in a little
while we are at Trafalgar, to which sailors still look as the
greatest sea fight in the history of our land, and as the one
which saved our national existence.&nbsp; And we step on shore at
Gibraltar, which rises out of the water, with its endless rows of
barracks and its few scattered villas, and <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>make our way
to the lightning-struck tower known as O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s
Folly&mdash;the O&rsquo;Hara who was the friend of Johnson, and
who ought to have married either Fanny Burney or Hannah More.</p>
<p>But it is idle to call up what to most of modern readers must
be bare names, so soon, in this age of reading and writing and
universal progress, do we forget the past.&nbsp; History in these
mechanical days is getting as much out of fashion as
theology.&nbsp; Let me write of living people; of men and women,
poor creatures as they are at the best, to be brushed away as
gossamer.&nbsp; There are just upon a thousand of us in the shape
of passengers on board the <i>Orizaba</i>, and almost all are
happy.&nbsp; The dark figure in the shape of Black Care we have
left behind, as we have slipped out of English fog and cold into
the region of cloudless nights and starry skies.&nbsp; We smoke,
or read, or talk, or walk the deck, in a climate brighter even
than that of an English summer in the leafy month of June.&nbsp;
The ladies crochet or knit all day long in their lounging-chairs
on deck, while the little ones play as if they had no fear or
thought of the sea and its everlasting hunger for precious human
life, and its cruel storms.&nbsp; What we should do with this
unmanageable mass if anything were to go wrong no tongue can
tell.&nbsp; All we can do is to hope for the best, for no <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Parliament
will ever go so far as to order that no ship should leave an
English port without its sufficient complement of boats; and if
they did, no shipowner could carry on a profitable passenger
trade.&nbsp; It ought not to be so, I know.&nbsp; What can one
do?&nbsp; We are bound to travel, and we take the risk, whatever
that may be, and trust to our sailors and captains, who are not
half paid for the work they have to do.&nbsp; As it is, there is
no life so pleasant as that of life on board one of our great
passenger steamships.&nbsp; The <i>Orizaba</i> never
rolls&mdash;well, only a little.&nbsp; The saloons are beautiful,
the living is first-rate, the waiting is excellent, and the
sleeping-berths are all that can be desired.&nbsp; By night, with
the electric light all along the deck, the scene reminds you of
the Arabian Nights, and mirth and music are everywhere; I pity
the poor people who have to spend their winter at home.&nbsp; It
is now a real pleasure to live.&nbsp; The only thing one misses
are the newspapers and the old familiar faces.&nbsp; Well, I am
not sorry to be out of the way of the papers; they only make me
sick and sore as one reads the daily chronicle of poverty with
which no one can grapple, and of crime which it seems impossible
to repress, and the twaddle which envelops all.&nbsp; And as to
the familiar faces, the further one travels the more one realizes
all their loveliness and <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>charm.&nbsp; For once the poet is
right; absence does make the heart grow fonder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you like our little town?&rsquo; said an
Englishman to me as I was about to leave Gibraltar for our good
ship, the <i>Orizaba</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;for a place to spend an hour in I like it
amazingly.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s about it!&rsquo;
was his reply.&nbsp; It seems to me, however, as I plough my way
on the blue waters of the Mediterranean&mdash;not bluer, however,
at present than what we have on the English coast&mdash;that a
couple of days may be agreeably spent at the far-famed rock, of
which, however, you get a very fair idea without stepping on
shore.&nbsp; As your eye rests on the harbour you see it full of
steamers, which seem to come and go at all hours.&nbsp; As I
write a French steamer slowly glides by with the yellow flag
denoting sickness of some kind on board.&nbsp; Before us is the
town, on our left the old Moorish fort&mdash;the oldest building
in the place&mdash;and on our right the hospital, with houses
reaching almost to the end.&nbsp; All the space between is filled
with yellow or white houses, save where a thick grove indicates
the existence of the Alameda, a public garden, where the band
plays, where the townsfolk promenade, and which, with its
cactuses and geraniums in full bloom, looks bright and gay even
in December.&nbsp; The company have so arranged <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>that you can
step into a boat and get rowed to shore and back for a shilling
each way&mdash;an example which I recommend to the corporation of
Gravesend.</p>
<p>I land, and declining a carriage drawn by mules amid the loud
vociferations of the Spanish owners, turn to my left, and find
myself in the main street, the only ugly building in which is the
red-brick mansion in which the British Governor resides.&nbsp;
All the houses are shops&mdash;full of the little trifles of
Morocco manufacture, such as pipes and jewellery and gay mats and
carpets, with which we are familiar at home.&nbsp; There are
20,000 Spanish residents, and the place swarms with them.&nbsp;
There are some 5,000 British soldiers here, and they are <i>en
evidence</i>, as was to be expected.&nbsp; They have five years
to stop here at a time, and they evidently think that&mdash;as
indeed it is&mdash;too long.&nbsp; One of the first things to
interest you is the little graveyard on your right, in which the
heroes of the siege were buried&mdash;shaded by trees, especially
by a fig-tree of gigantic size and very old, as you can tell by
the smallness of the leaf.&nbsp; A building which attracts your
eye just before you enter the busy street is that of the Soldiers
and Sailors&rsquo; Institute, which is erected on a freehold
site, and comprises on the ground floor a coffee and
refreshment-bar, dining-room, bath-room, and lavatories; on <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the first
floor a reading, writing, and recreation-room, with a small
library; and above is a large hall for mission services, public
meetings, Bible classes, and mothers&rsquo; meetings.&nbsp; The
soldiers and sailors, I fear, do not appreciate the advantages as
they might, though Mr. Holmes, the superintendent, tells me at
times the hall is more than filled.&nbsp; It is in the
streets&mdash;or rather in the people that crowd them&mdash;the
chief charm of Gibraltar lies.</p>
<p>The life of the place is <i>al fresco</i>; everyone seems out
of doors.&nbsp; Carts drawn by mules or donkeys, with country
produce, bright little carriages to hold two or four persons as
the case may be, the English officer on horseback&mdash;all these
block up the middle of the street; whilst on the narrow sideway
you wind your difficult way amongst monks and nuns and dark-eyed
Spanish women with the national head-dress, and Moors who shuffle
along bare-legged, with slippers to their feet, their whole
person enveloped in their ample, hooded brown or blue cloak,
while some wear the picturesque turban, and others simply rejoice
in the well-known fez.&nbsp; As I contemplate the motley group a
black-eyed and black-bearded, aristocratic-looking Moor makes a
dart at me with a couple of fowls; but, as I decline to purchase,
he manages to ask me for a penny&mdash;and, let me add, in vain,
for I <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>could not think of insulting such a gentleman by
offering him so ridiculously small a sum.&nbsp; But I see no
beggars, and if the common people look dirty, at any rate they
appear to be well fed.&nbsp; I fancy a good deal of British gold,
somehow or other, finds its way into their pockets.&nbsp; There
are no ragged scoundrels to be seen, such as infest our London
streets and are the terror of suburban residents.&nbsp; As you
pass, the shopkeeper stands at his door and bids you look at his
miscellaneous wares.</p>
<p>Of British manufactures I see little, except the biscuits of
Huntley and Palmer or Peek and Frean.&nbsp; I see no shops with
books except the dep&ocirc;t of the British and Foreign Bible
Society&mdash;but the people manage to live, nevertheless.&nbsp;
Meat is but sixpence a pound.&nbsp; You buy beautiful oranges at
a shilling a hundred.&nbsp; The only dear thing in the place is
house-rent.&nbsp; Not a room is to be had under five shillings a
week.&nbsp; Some of my fellow-passengers dined at the leading
hotel, and they think, and I agree with them, that the charge was
rather high.&nbsp; Only goats&rsquo; milk is to be had, but as to
cheap wine and low-priced spirits, they are to be procured in
abundance, as two of our steerage passengers find out to their
cost, as we leave them behind, and some who do manage to return
may be termed rather fresh.&nbsp; The one great drawback of <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Gibraltar, as
regards the resident, is the absence of fresh butter.&nbsp; Alas!
&lsquo;man never is, but always to be blest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of what
avail are cheap cigars and wine and meat without fresh
butter?&nbsp; Many have their bread buttered on both sides, and
surely the humblest of us have a right to its being buttered on
one, at any rate.&nbsp; But I may not linger, as I know the
<i>Orizaba</i> will sail at the appointed hour; but we seem long
in getting out of the crowd of boats, full of oranges and cigars,
the proprietors of which are doing a roaring trade with the
steerage passengers, who let down the money from the deck and
receive in exchange oranges that will set them up for the rest of
their journey, and away we go, leaving the Rock, at the bottom of
which nestle the yellow rows of streets and houses, all with
green or white lattices, whilst on its lofty head rests a drizzly
cloud worthy of Devonshire itself.&nbsp; On the other side of us
are the brown African mountains&mdash;we steer between them as
the day closes in, and early in the morning I open my eyes to see
afar on our left, the rocky outline of Spain, and then we lose
sight of land, and can see nothing but the Mediterranean till
early on Saturday morning we pass the first lighthouse on the
coast of Sardinia.&nbsp; We are now coming to ancient history,
but for that I refer the reader to Rollin, the terror of British
youth in an age of which <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the present reader, intelligent
though he may be in his way, has but a faint idea.</p>
<p>People who believe in Italian skies and summer seas ought not
to trust themselves in the Mediterranean in December.&nbsp; We
had what the captain calls &lsquo;a very heavy gale of
wind,&rsquo; after we left the &lsquo;Rock,&rsquo; which lasted
till we were almost in the Bay of Naples&mdash;a gale that sent
all the ladies to bed, and damped the spirits of everyone on
board.&nbsp; I had the full benefit of all the discomfort, as,
instead of choosing a berth for myself, I left it to the
officials, believing that in fine weather any berth is pleasant,
and in bad weather all are equally disagreeable.&nbsp; But at any
rate I should not have chosen the one allotted me, the very last
of the berths forward (you are aware that in the boats going
through the Red Sea the best berths are all forward, on account
of the heat), but in my case, unfortunately, every wave that fell
on the deck all night long came with a heavy thump overhead,
which did not exactly secure me a good night&rsquo;s rest.&nbsp;
However, all was forgotten as we steamed on Sunday morning past
rocky Ischia into the famous Bay of Naples, which is far fairer
than that of Swansea&mdash;in spite of all that gallant little
Wales may say to the contrary.&nbsp; As I write the view is
simply charming.&nbsp; All Naples is before me.&nbsp; On <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>my left rises
the lofty hill on which stands the Castle of St. Elmo.&nbsp; On
my right are two high mountains&mdash;one of them, by the cloud
of smoke hanging over it, and the flame of fire issuing from it,
renders it quite unnecessary that I should ask anyone its
name.&nbsp; You can tell Vesuvius at a glance.&nbsp; All the low
land gradually rising away from the sea between them forms the
site of delightful but dirty Naples.</p>
<p>I land as soon as the necessary formalities have been gone
through&mdash;for they are very particular at Naples, and our
purser and medical officer have first to go ashore in order to
satisfy the authorities, a work sometimes extending over two
hours.&nbsp; Fortunately, however, in a little while they are
back, and we crowd on board the company&rsquo;s tender, which for
half-a-crown conveys the passengers on shore and returns them
safe and sound as late as eleven or twelve o&rsquo;clock at
night.&nbsp; Boats of all kinds are around us.&nbsp; One contains
a bold swimmer, who performs all sorts of wonderful exploits;
others are laden with straw hats and baskets, and vendors of
oranges and cheap jewellery and pipes, lava match-boxes, and
amber mouthpieces.&nbsp; As I board the tender a pretty, smiling
Italian flower-dealer puts a small camellia in my coat, which,
however, I am ungallant enough to return.&nbsp; I fear she is
like the flower-girls of Paris of whom <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Tom Moore writes, that they spoil a
romance with pecuniary views.&nbsp; In a few minutes I am on
shore amid a crowd of dirty black-haired and black-eyed Italians,
who offer me carriages and guides with an intensity of verbosity
(recalling that of a certain Grand Old Man) sufficient to appal
the stoutest heart.</p>
<p>I am rather disappointed at first.&nbsp; Cook&rsquo;s agents
were to come on board, and one of them did put in an appearance,
but that was all, which was a pity, as many of us were trusting
to Cook as a tower of strength.&nbsp; In one respect I was
especially disappointed.&nbsp; Cook was to take us all to
Pompeii, give us lunch there, and bring us back for 12s.; but,
alas! the King&rsquo;s uncle had died, and Pompeii was shut up,
and so was the Museum.&nbsp; What a misfortune it is that royal
personages should trouble us so much!&nbsp; While alive, of
course we must do all we can for them; but surely, when dead,
when they have fairly passed to where the wicked cease from
troubling and the weary are at rest, it is hard that they annoy
us still.&nbsp; Many of us may never again have a chance of
seeing Pompeii.&nbsp; But I steer clear of the guides and start
off for a three hours&rsquo; prowl.&nbsp; What strikes the
stranger is the loftiness of the houses, the narrowness of the
streets, and the number of people.&nbsp; Locomotion in some is
almost impossible, so dense is the crowd; <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>while it is
the same in others in consequence of the number of equipages,
chiefly open carriages drawn by black horses quite overdone with
heavily-plated harness.&nbsp; To add to the difficulties there
has been a slight shower of rain, and as the scavenger seems to
be unknown, the streets are very slippery; I saw one little child
run over in consequence.&nbsp; Another difficulty of the
pedestrian is the number of stalls on each side, for the sale,
apparently, of everything that can be brought into the street to
tempt the purchaser.</p>
<p>Judging by the number of bookstalls, the Neapolitans must be
very great readers, for I never saw so many anywhere else.&nbsp;
In many of the streets that run between the leading
thoroughfares, the passage is so narrow that it would be almost
easy to shake hands across.&nbsp; All the lofty houses are
yellow, with green latticed windows and balconies.&nbsp; In many
of the churches into which I peeped Mass was in progress, and the
attendance was large of men as well as women.&nbsp; In some of
the streets the shops were handsome, though quite small, while in
the great arches between were caves, as it were, where carriages
and horses waited, apparently for hire, while in others the cave
had been fitted up as a <i>caf&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; The further one
got from the harbour, the finer were the shops and streets.&nbsp;
In one I saw a statue of Petrarch, and in <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>another of
Dante.&nbsp; The place is like a rabbit warren, and just as
populous.&nbsp; Priests and policemen were everywhere.&nbsp; Here
and there was a religious painting on the side of a house, before
which tapers were burning, and in one street I observed a
crucifix, to which the passers-by took off their hats.&nbsp; I
went into a <i>caf&eacute;</i> and watched some play at a
billiard-table, much smaller and with much bigger balls than
those in use among us.&nbsp; Omnibuses and tramcars
abounded.&nbsp; Perpetual motion seemed to be the order of the
day.&nbsp; Some of my friends patronized the English hotels,
where the charges seemed to me dear.&nbsp; One thing, and one
thing only, amused me; I stumbled on a kind of eating-house; on
the outside was inscribed, <i>D&eacute;jeuner &agrave; la
fourchette</i>, which was Englished underneath as follows:
&lsquo;Breakfast to the fork.&rsquo;&nbsp; I did not enter.&nbsp;
I feared, as the English was so bad, that the cooking might be
worse.&nbsp; Altogether, my impression is that Naples looks best
at a distance and by moonlight, when a halo of soft light is
thrown over bay and street and mountain far away, and the hoarse
cry of its thousand street-sellers and cabmen and guides is
unheard; when even the distant tinkling of the bells of its many
churches no longer reaches the ear; when between you and the
crowded city is a world of water calm and still.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>At
Naples we took up more passengers and more mountains of
luggage.&nbsp; Our captain is in despair.&nbsp; That luggage
question is the terror of his life.&nbsp; He says that there
would be no need of it if the company would but establish a
laundry on board; and why should they not?&nbsp; It would be a
great convenience to everyone, and save a vast amount of
trouble.&nbsp; The cabins are choked up with packages.&nbsp; It
would be as pleasant again for the passengers if they could have
their clothes washed on board.</p>
<p>I fear I did injustice to a dead royalty.&nbsp; I find, after
all, it was simply the fault of the company&rsquo;s agent at
Naples that most of us spent an idle day in that far-famed
city.&nbsp; The distinguished representative of the distinguished
Cook informed us that the Museum and Pompeii were closed that
day, because the agent of the company with whom he came on board
informed him such was the case.&nbsp; I find that they were not,
and that a small party of our fellow-travellers visited both
places; had lunch on shore, returned to the ship to dinner, and
paid a visit to the theatre in the evening for a sum under
&pound;1 per head.&nbsp; As you may suppose, most of us were
highly indignant at the conduct of the company&rsquo;s agent, and
described him in terms that, with the fear of the libel law in
view, it may be dangerous for me to report.&nbsp; I <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>mention the
fact that travellers may not be deceived by what they hear on
board, but go on shore and act for themselves.&nbsp; Many of my
fellow-travellers are Scotch.&nbsp; The Scotch, Mr. Charles Reade
tells us, are icebergs with volcanoes underneath, and we had
quite a volcano on board as we summed up the experiences of the
unfortunate day.&nbsp; I own it served me right, for, as a rule,
I only believe half that I hear.&nbsp; I ought to have started
for Pompeii&mdash;by myself, trusting to luck to get into the
place.&nbsp; I am glad, however, to be able to do justice to Cook
and Sons, the friends of the traveller in every part of the
world.&nbsp; It is seldom that they make a blunder, or their
agents either.</p>
<p>In another respect I am not disappointed.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
grand object of travelling,&rsquo; wrote Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;is
to see the shores of the Mediterranean.&nbsp; On those shores
were the four great empires of the world&mdash;the Assyrian, the
Persian, the Grecian, and the Roman.&nbsp; All our
religion&mdash;almost all our laws&mdash;almost all our
arts&mdash;almost all that sets us above savages has come to us
from the shores of the Mediterranean.&rsquo;&nbsp; To sail down
the Mediterranean, past Capri&mdash;a sunburnt rock&mdash;past
Stromboli, through the Straits of Messina, over the far-famed
Scylla and Charybdis of the ancients, past Etna, though
unfortunately hidden from our <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>vulgar gaze by the clouds of night,
is undoubtedly an immense treat.&nbsp; But the rest of the
journey is rather monotonous, though we were favoured by fine
weather, a fortunate circumstance, as this part of the
Mediterranean is particularly liable to sudden storms; and if it
were not for sea-quoits, and the still more popular game of
dumps, which consists in throwing small flat balls with lead
inside on to a white-painted square board, on which numerals from
one to ten are inscribed, it would be rather hard work to get
through the weary hours.&nbsp; At Naples an agent came on board
with the London morning papers four days old, which sold readily
at half a franc each, and the perusal of them has helped to kill
an idle time, and, besides, afforded topics for general
conversation.&nbsp; For pedestrian exercise the <i>Orizaba</i> is
admirably adapted, as eleven times round the promenade deck is
supposed to be a mile, and at certain hours every one is supposed
to be doing his or her &lsquo;constitutional;&rsquo; thus, what
used to be considered one of the bad effects of life at sea, its
confinement, is entirely got rid of.&nbsp; Captain Conlan, our
commander-in-chief, when off duty, has a friendly word for us
all; but I must say, if tobacco be a slow poison, some of us are
in a bad way, for I think without exception all the male
passengers smoke; and at Gibraltar, where tobacco and <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>cigars are
cheap, most of them replenished their exhausted stores.</p>
<p>The principal event after leaving the Straits of Messina is
the appearance of Crete, by the side of which, with her
snowy-capped mountains, we steamed for about five hours.&nbsp;
From her rocky foreground, resting on the blue waves, rise three
mountain ridges, the chief of which &lsquo;is many-founted
Ida,&rsquo; towering 8,000 feet above the sea.&nbsp; As a caution
to travellers, let me assure them how much one of Smith&rsquo;s
dictionaries would be appreciated.&nbsp; Smith, it may be, is
correct, but he is pedantic.&nbsp; Lempri&egrave;re would,
perhaps, be better; in the home of legendary lore it is not wise
to be over-critical.&nbsp; The Orient Company publishes a
guide-book, but it is of little practical use, though it contains
an immense amount of information, some excellent maps, and is a
marvel of cheapness.&nbsp; You rarely get in such books what you
really want to know.&nbsp; We have a professor on board, but
professors nowadays are somewhat common.&nbsp; Men who shave and
cut corns&mdash;men who examine your head, who risk their necks
in parachutes, who excel in gymnastics, are called, or call
themselves, professors; and I, perhaps because I know no
better&mdash;probably it is so&mdash;may be a little sceptical as
to the class.&nbsp; I <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>always think of Barry
Cornwall&rsquo;s lines in which he speaks of</p>
<blockquote><p>Professors of hall and college,<br />
With a great deal of learning and little knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, alas! I have known many such.&nbsp; It amuses me more to
talk to some of the third-class passengers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,
sir,&rsquo; said one of them to me, as we steamed out of Naples
Bay&mdash;&lsquo;ah, sir, that is a very wicked city; it allus
reminds me of Nineveh.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was compelled to admit that
I did not know much of the wickedness of either; but that I did
happen to know that, excluding Jack the Ripper, there were not a
few wicked people left in London.&nbsp; I always like to look at
home before I begin censuring other people.&nbsp; There is a good
deal of truth in the remark of the old Californian, when Sir
Charles Dilke told him &lsquo;Californians in the Empire City
were called the scum of the earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Them New
Yorkers,&rsquo; was the old man&rsquo;s reply, &lsquo;is a sight
too fond of looking after other people&rsquo;s morals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just as we are nearing the lowlands of Africa, and Port
Said&mdash;a wretched place, where we stop a few hours to
coal&mdash;is in sight, a death occurs on board; a tiny babe,
weary of the world of which it knows so little, refuses to live
any longer.&nbsp; In the drawing-room few of us know of the
event, and the gaiety goes on much as usual.&nbsp; I rush on to
the deck, and <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>see a dark cloud of passengers at one end, and there is
the Bishop standing at a red kind of box or reading-desk,
repeating that grand burial service which is nowhere more
impressive than when heard in the ocean&rsquo;s solitude, with
nothing but the wide, wide sea below, and the clear, moonlight
sky above.&nbsp; The parents are, of course, there to mourn, and
the bearing of the little crowd is sympathetic.&nbsp; The poor
little corpse, covered by the British flag, is placed on an
inclined board, which is tipped over when the sentence &lsquo;we
commit this body to the deep&rsquo; is reached, and the sea
receives its dead.&nbsp; I had only asked the doctor that morning
what was the state of health on board the ship, and his reply was
that it was as well as could be.&nbsp; Perhaps steerage
passengers don&rsquo;t count, especially when babies.&nbsp; At
any rate, the funeral is over, and we are taking our evening tea
as if nothing of consequence had occurred&mdash;as if no tender
mother&rsquo;s heart had been torn with anguish as she saw her
babe fall a victim to the Reaper whose name is Death.&nbsp; Not
for a moment did the ship slacken her career, and we press on to
Port Said with all our might.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> a vermilion sky, as the sun
sinks down into the west, we approach the land of Egypt&mdash;a
barren land, kindly to neither man nor beast, fruitful only in
sand, and hospitable only to the camel, who seems here to be a
friend in need, patiently following his turbaned leader over the
pathless desert.&nbsp; We have a little sand near Southport, we
have more still on the Lincolnshire coast at Skegness, we have
most of all on the Dutch coast, from Flushing to Scheveningen,
that gay resort of the Dutchmen and the Germans; but they fail to
give you an idea of the dreary and boundless waste of sand
through which that wonderful old man, M. de Lesseps, cut his
grand canal, which ought to have been done by Englishmen, and
which perhaps <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>would have been, had not Lord Palmerston declared in
season and out of season that it could not be done, and that if
it were done it could never pay.&nbsp; When we stopped at Port
Said, looking as if only artificially raised out of the sea, I
landed: partly to say I had planted the sole of my foot in
Egypt&mdash;the land of the Pharaohs, of Joseph and his brothers,
of Antony and Cleopatra, of Origen and Hypatia and early
Christian hermits, of grand philosophies and theologies, which
stir the pulses even of to-day&mdash;and partly that I might have
an evening stroll in a place not at one time the safest for a
white man to land, but which now is quite as free from danger as
any London neighbourhood&mdash;the happy hunting-ground of the
burglar and the thief.&nbsp; The fact was that at Port Said we
had to coal; and as we landed after dinner, it was a new
sensation to be rowed ashore by turbaned sailors, who were
clothed in what seemed to me in the twilight very much like
petticoats.&nbsp; It was rather risky, as the boat was crammed
down to the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; Nor was I much reassured
as, after running up against the ropes and being nearly capsized,
the man at the prow called out in broken English, &lsquo;Never
mind,&rsquo; to which I was obliged to reply that I did mind, and
that I ventured to hope he would take care of our precious
carcases.&nbsp; Apparently the advice was not thrown away, for
after <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>a
few minutes&rsquo; row, and after an attempt had been made to
collect the fare, which we all firmly resisted till on <i>terra
firma</i>, we landed where a couple of old women apparently, in
reality sailors, were standing with lanterns ready to receive
us.&nbsp; As the fare was only sixpence each way, I can&rsquo;t
say that the Egyptian watermen were quite so exorbitant as some I
wot of nearer home.&nbsp; There was not much to see at Port Said;
but it was better to be there than on board ship while the
process of coaling was going on.&nbsp; While at dinner there was
a sound all round as if a million of monkeys were screaming and
jabbering underneath.&nbsp; They were the coalheavers, on board
the big barges laden with coal that surrounded us on all sides
directly we had come to anchor.&nbsp; Each barge had two lights
of burning coals, by the glare of which we could see the porters
in strings of fifty at a time climbing up a ladder that led to
the ship&rsquo;s inside, with coal-sacks on their shoulders, and
streaming back again, all the while screaming, as seems to be the
manner of the Arab tribe all the world over.&nbsp; They all
scream.&nbsp; They screamed at us as we stood on the deck; they
screamed at us as they rowed us ashore; they screamed at us as we
walked the streets&mdash;or, rather, the one long street which
forms the town till it is lost in the sand of the surrounding
waste.&nbsp; On one side lies the <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>market, and a mile or two beyond is
the old Arabian town.&nbsp; Men of all nationalities are well
represented in Port Said; but the Greeks have the best shops,
where a fine trade is done in cigarettes, photographs, and
richly-worked napkins, and helmets to keep off the sun in the Red
Sea, and the other products to be met with in Turkish
bazaars.&nbsp; In the street it was difficult to tell the men
from the women, so weird and unearthly seemed their make-up in
the evening gloom.&nbsp; Two of the dark bundles approaching me
were, I concluded, women, as the faces were concealed&mdash;all
but the dark, round eyes, from the dangerous glances of which,
happily, my age protected me.&nbsp; The great attraction of the
place was a large <i>caf&eacute; chantant</i>, which, however, I
fancy, did duty as a gambling-house as well.&nbsp; On the bank,
just as you land, is a large building calling itself the Hotel
Continental; but as it was shut up, apparently it has not been a
commercial success.&nbsp; The houses, or, rather, the
shops&mdash;for there were nothing but shops to be
seen&mdash;were all of wood and painted.&nbsp; On my return to
the ship, which was covered with coal-dust, I found we had an
Egyptian conjurer, who went through a performance such as we see
any day in England.&nbsp; But I must not say a word against a
gentleman who was so kind as to intimate that I was &lsquo;a big
masher.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>For a
real Lotus-land, where it is always afternoon, commend me to the
Suez Canal.&nbsp; It is a busy spot.&nbsp; No spot is
busier.&nbsp; Steamers, especially English ones, are always
passing up and down.&nbsp; It is an expensive spot.&nbsp; You are
fortunate if your steamer has not to pay a thousand or two for
the trip.&nbsp; The <i>Orizaba</i> has to pay &pound;1,700 for
going through; but that does not concern you, if you have taken
your passage to Ismailia or Colombo, or one or other of the great
Australian ports.&nbsp; All that you have to do is to sit still
and enjoy yourself.&nbsp; There the good sailor and the bad one
are equal.&nbsp; There you fear no north or south simoom, no seas
mountains high (I have never yet seen them, and begin to believe
in them only as I do in stories of mermaids and mermen, or in
legends of the sea-serpent ever turning up at unexpected times
and in unexpected quarters), no rough blasts of the winter winds,
no equinoctial gales.&nbsp; The captain comes down from his
bridge, the officers take it easy, and you really need not to
drive dull care away.&nbsp; On that calm water, under that bright
sky, you have no thought of time.&nbsp; All around you is still
life&mdash;the boundless sands, the distant hills, the camels,
and the Arabs encamped far away.&nbsp; All is repose, in the
heavens above, as well as in the earth beneath.&nbsp; It is true
the beggars here and there on the banks are a nuisance, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>but where are
they not, either in the Old World or the New?&nbsp; For eighteen
or twenty hours you are at peace&mdash;to read the last novel, to
flirt with the last fancy of the hour; to dream, if you like, in
the broad daylight of other days and other times.&nbsp; The big
ship moves, but so slowly that you can scarce tell that you are
moving at all.&nbsp; The stewards bring your meals as usual; your
sleep is undisturbed.&nbsp; There is your morning bath, your
accustomed cigar, your game of chess, or your rubber of
whist.&nbsp; Ah, you are much to be envied!&nbsp; The pity of it
is that the trip is so soon over; that the dream is soon
dispelled; that the curtain so soon falls on the scene; that you
have to get back again to the cares, and troubles, and struggles
of real life.</p>
<p>In the matter of the Suez Canal, Englishmen are paying rather
dearly for their faith in Lord Palmerston.&nbsp; It is to the
credit of M. de Lesseps that he conceived the idea, got together
the money, and carried it out, and by that means, as a patriotic
Frenchman, secured for France an influence in Egypt which, not to
put too fine a point on it, has not worked for the advantage of
either Egypt or ourselves.&nbsp; The officials of the Canal are
French, the official language is French, the neat little
stations, with their painted wooden houses, protected here and
there by a palm <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>tree struggling for life, are pre-eminently
French.&nbsp; Fortunately, Lord Beaconsfield bought some shares
for the nation, which gives us a <i>locus standi</i>.&nbsp; But
the Canal, you feel, ought to have been designed by British
engineers and paid for by British gold.&nbsp; It is emphatically
England that keeps it going.&nbsp; The stream of steamers ever
sailing up and down by day or by night are chiefly English
steamers built in British shipyards, sailed by British captains
and officers, and filled with British goods.&nbsp; It is true
France subsidizes her steamers to struggle with England in all
parts of the world.&nbsp; It is equally true that Germany does
the same, but they cannot beat the British merchant and
shipowner, who will not yield without a fierce struggle the
supremacy it has taken them centuries to build up and sustain,
and if the Canal manages to pay a dividend, it is because of the
constant passage of British ships.&nbsp; As we were steaming
along the Canal in one of the finest steamers of the Orient line,
and of any line, we met a French steamer on her homeward
trip.&nbsp; Mounseer looked politely at our crowded
deck&mdash;his own seemed deserted, though they do tell me that
the accommodation on board the French ships is remarkably good,
and then our steerage commenced singing with heart and soul
&lsquo;Rule, Britannia.&rsquo;&nbsp; They ought <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>not to have
done it, I know.&nbsp; It was a breach of good manners; but if
anywhere we may be pardoned for singing &lsquo;Rule,
Britannia,&rsquo; it is in the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>On leaving Port Said, in a few minutes you are in the Canal,
which has been here protected from the shifting sand by a
breakwater a mile and a half long.&nbsp; On Lake Menzaleh, to the
westward, are to be seen wonderful flights and flocks of birds,
including pelicans and flamingoes, to detect which, however,
requires an uncommonly strong glass.&nbsp; Ships are piloted on
the block system, under the control of the head official at Port
Said, who telegraphs the movements of each ship as it slowly
makes its way.&nbsp; At each of the stations, or
&lsquo;gares,&rsquo; there are signal-posts, and a ball above a
flag says &lsquo;Go into the siding,&rsquo; while a flag above a
ball says &lsquo;Go into the Canal.&rsquo;&nbsp; You see a good
deal of the country, an utter, miserable desert at first, but
soon hidden by the sand-banks.&nbsp; As you get nearer to Suez,
wandering Arabs and droves of camels may be seen making their way
along the burning waste, under the burning sun.&nbsp; All day and
all night the heavens are wonderful.&nbsp; Now and then you meet
a ship, and there is not much room to spare; now and then one is
run aground, and it is often weary waiting, as it is inexpedient
to go on shore and take a donkey-ride, in compliance with the
request of the <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>donkey-drivers, who seem to scent a stoppage from afar,
and come to the bank, clamouring vociferously all the
while.&nbsp; As you proceed you find the boys and girls on each
side keeping you company, in hopes of the copper the kind-hearted
visitor may feel inclined to throw them.&nbsp; It is needless to
add that they are loosely clad, and are brown and sunburnt to
look at.&nbsp; By night the electric light on the sandy bank has
a singularly strange effect, which is more particularly apparent
as another ship approaches, making the sand where it catches the
light seem as if there were drifts of snow all round.&nbsp; As
you enter the lakes the waters widen, and the speed is greater;
the scenery is also a little more attractive.&nbsp; Away on your
right is the land of Goshen, and Ismailia clusters prettily
around the summer palace of the Khedive.&nbsp; Here you drop the
passengers for Cairo, who are increasing in number every
year&mdash;that part of Egypt becoming increasingly a winter
resort, essential to the comfort and well-being of those who do
not care for English cold and fog and rain.&nbsp; It is a
wonderful change and a great relief for the asthmatic to spend a
winter in Egypt.&nbsp; It is a pity that more cannot do so, but,
alas! few of us can spare the time, and many of us have not the
cash, and so a man must live where his bread is buttered, though
to do so prolongs his pains <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>at the same time that it shortens his
life.&nbsp; As you look at Ismailia it seems a charming spot;
however, the condition of the place is by no means sanitary, and
danger lurks there under those green trees, beside those still
waters.&nbsp; It has, however, been the scene of high life, as
when the Canal was opened in 1869, when the Empress Eugenie, the
Crown Prince of Prussia and the Empress of Austria took part in
the ceremony.&nbsp; At a later date there was also exciting work
in Ismailia when it became the basis of &lsquo;our only
general&rsquo;s&rsquo; brilliant campaign.&nbsp; The Canal and
lakes were filled with transports and men-of-war, and to the town
an army of 20,000 men looked for supplies.&nbsp; It was from
thence they marched to fight the battle of Tel-el-Kebir, and to
send poor Arabia prisoner for life to Ceylon, where, perhaps,
after all, he is better off than he would have been had he
stopped at home.&nbsp; His life would have been sacrificed had he
remained.</p>
<p>Little of life is to be seen anywhere, but a few men are
engaged in cutting away the sand, while camels bear it far
away.&nbsp; They are ugly beasts, and never seem happy.&nbsp;
They are, however, docile, and kneel down while the men fill the
panniers with sand, when they rise up and walk away; or we come
to a ferry where they are waiting to cross, and display the <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>same patient,
forbearing, half-starved look.&nbsp; The Egyptian donkey seems to
me a far livelier animal.&nbsp; Now and then a dog displays
itself on the bank, but he is rarely a favourable specimen of his
race.&nbsp; Small steamers and barges, occupied in connection
with the improvement of the canal, are also met, but the crew
take little note of the white man, who, however, after all, has
got such a hold on the land that it is questionable, whatever
statesmen say at Westminster, whether it can ever be
removed.&nbsp; It seems as if Egypt could never be let
alone.&nbsp; True, it was a great country once, but that was long
ago.</p>
<p>Again, we leave the Timseh, or the Crocodile Lake, behind, and
make our way to the Bitter Lakes, through many miles of
Canal.&nbsp; The lakes, history tells us, are the remains of a
dried-up arm of the sea, where once flourished the ancient port
of Arsinoe.&nbsp; Here we meet the slight tides of the Red
Sea&mdash;that awful sea, whose waters at some seasons range to a
temperature of a hundred.&nbsp; It was hot as we entered Port
Said, it is hotter as we leave the Canal at Suez&mdash;the new
port of which, with its modernized hotel, its rows of trees, and
its modern warehouses, looks pretty from the water.&nbsp; Old
Suez, a mile and a half from the new town, is visible long before
we reach the fort.&nbsp; It is almost a pity that the steamers do
not <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>stay
here a day or two.&nbsp; The old town is the most characteristic
of old Egypt, and the rail will run you up there in a few
minutes.&nbsp; It was the centre of the highway between Asia and
Africa.&nbsp; All around is the desert, while mountains famed in
history for ages are to be seen from afar.&nbsp; Egyptians tell
me that Suez is preferable to Cairo as a health resort.&nbsp; One
gentleman whom I met with told me that he wintered there every
year.&nbsp; As we picked him up on my return, I was obliged to
tell him that he did not look so well as when he went ashore a
few months previously.&nbsp; In excuse he owned that he had
suffered from a severe attack of rheumatic fever.&nbsp; It may be
that Suez had nothing to do with that.&nbsp; Perhaps at Cairo
they would have told me Suez was not a good place to go to.&nbsp;
The water, however, is good, as we took a good many tons of it on
board.&nbsp; It was well that we did so.&nbsp; At Aden, our next
stopping-place, we found there had been no rain for nearly three
years.</p>
<p>We stop a few hours at Suez, and early in the morning commence
steaming down the Gulf of Suez, ere we float proudly over the
waters of the Red Sea.&nbsp; At length it seems to me that we
realize all that the poets have sung and painters have drawn of
the Bay of Naples&mdash;unclouded skies and a sea of brilliant <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>blue.&nbsp;
All day long we are in sight of a romantic coast crowned with
towering mountains, with diversified peaks that in the sun seem
to glow with light and heat.&nbsp; As we approach they are brown
or white or red, and then, behind, they seem dark and stern as
they rise out of the sleeping waters.&nbsp; On our left are the
Arabian mountains&mdash;Mount Sinai among them&mdash;more or less
connected with the religion dear to all men of Anglo-Saxon race
and tongue; the religion that has made modern history what it
is&mdash;the religion which they tell us in the pulpit is yet to
reign supreme.&nbsp; At dark&mdash;and it soon gets very dark in
these regions, in spite of the grand stars which shine lustrously
on us in a way of which no untravelled Englishman can form any
adequate idea&mdash;we are on the Red Sea, having just passed the
wreck of a steamer, as if to remind us that even in these days of
science there are accidents arising from fogs and currents and
hidden rocks and shoals which it is hard for any human ingenuity
to guard against.&nbsp; Just now a good deal of interest attaches
to the Red Sea.&nbsp; On our right are Suakim and Massowah,
though too far off to be visible.&nbsp; Small as the Red Sea
looks on the map, it is 1,200 miles long.&nbsp; Coral reefs and
islands are so numerous that navigation is difficult and
dangerous.&nbsp; The coast on either side seems deserted, and
only now and then a <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>lighthouse is to be seen, or the black hull of some
small Arabian trader, with the well-known enormous sail from the
yard-arm.&nbsp; However, there are one or two ports of importance
on either side.&nbsp; The chief of all is Jeddah&mdash;with a
population of 40,000&mdash;which is the port of the Mecca
pilgrims, and which beside is the chief market for pearls and the
black coffee and aromatic spices from Araby the Blest.&nbsp; Not
far off is Mocha, a name familiar to British ears, though the
place itself has fallen into decay.</p>
<p>So far as we have travelled the Red Sea has behaved uncommonly
well.&nbsp; On the last voyage the heat was so intense that three
times the ship had to be turned in order that the passengers
might have a breath of cool air.&nbsp; As it is, no one finds the
heat overpowering, and to me it yields the same amount of
enjoyment one feels in a Turkish bath after the sweating process
has got into full swing.&nbsp; We have little walking now except
in the early morning, or after dark, and no gymnastic exercise of
any kind.&nbsp; The little ones have already lost their rosy
cheeks.&nbsp; Sunday is well observed; one way or another there
is a good deal of preaching going on.&nbsp; The bishop takes in
hand the first-class passengers, while in the evening volunteer
preachers look after the souls of the second class.&nbsp; There
was a special service also in <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>the steerage in the afternoon, when
the singing was at any rate very hearty.</p>
<p>Of course we gaze with no little pleasure at the island of
Perim, standing in the deep water a few miles before we reach
Aden.&nbsp; The French would have had it, the story goes, had not
the Governor of Aden, who had his suspicions aroused as the
French commander, who was sent to plant there the French flag,
sat drinking champagne at his hospitable board, sent two notes,
one to the harbour-master ordering him to delay the coaling, and
another to the commander of a gunboat to sail at once with some
artillerymen for Perim.&nbsp; Such is the story as told by Sir
Charles Dilke and other clever men; but the real fact is that it
had been long before taken possession of by the old East India
Company.&nbsp; At any rate, it is of no use to our French
neighbours, now that they have lost Egypt, and that the control
of the Canal has passed into English hands.&nbsp; Now the French
have no Eastern Question.&nbsp; How we must all envy them!</p>
<p>In a little while we are out of the Red Sea, which at this
time of year is really agreeable.&nbsp; All day long we have had
a strong head wind, which has rendered the sultry atmosphere
quite cool and genial.&nbsp; Provided an invalid is a good
sailor, I should say, as far as we have gone, it would be
impossible for him to <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>have a more agreeable trip, or one
more likely to return him to his native land of fog and frost and
rain a better man.&nbsp; Everyone tells me that I am looking
wonderfully better for my voyage.&nbsp; I am glad to hear it, as
what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and I write
in the hope that those who can afford it will follow in my
steps.&nbsp; I have offered myself as an experiment for the sake
of my asthmatic and elderly friends.&nbsp; So far as I have gone
the experiment has succeeded beyond my most sanguine
expectations.</p>
<p>We made rather a long stay at Aden, where most of the party
went ashore; I did not, for of two evils a wise man chooses the
least, and it seemed to me a greater evil to be rowed ashore and
landed on a sunburnt rock where no water is than to fight with
the coal-dust on board and to listen to the perpetual chattering
of the natives.&nbsp; We have to be thankful that we are safe out
of the Red Sea, which is certainly, with its sunken coral reefs
and ragged rocks rising straight out of the water, as difficult a
piece of navigation as any of which I ever heard.&nbsp; A captain
had need be careful.&nbsp; The sights of Aden are few&mdash;a low
building or two on the rocks, a native town a few miles off (not
worth seeing), and water-tanks more useful than
picturesque.&nbsp; Before we had anchored the Somali boys <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>rowed round
us in their little cockleshell boats, ready to dive for any coin
thrown into the water.&nbsp; Then came the barges, black with
coal, with long, dark, lightly-dressed natives, to convey the
desirable mineral on board.&nbsp; Their woolly heads seem
impervious to the sun&rsquo;s rays, and if they have dark skins,
it but enhances the effect of their glistening teeth.&nbsp; The
costume I like best is that of the native policeman, which
consists of what looks to me like a nightgown, a turban, and a
black necklace.&nbsp; A couple of gentlemen come on board: they
wear blue jackets and rich-coloured silk skirts.&nbsp; Their hair
is done up in a knot behind, and is kept in good order in front
by a tortoise-shell comb.&nbsp; A few salesmen, with
ostrich-feathers or wicker baskets, come to do a little business,
but overboard the battle rages all day long, as the boys clamour
for coins and imploringly stretch their skinny arms to the upper
deck.&nbsp; A coin is tossed into the water: in a second they
turn heels over head and disappear, in another second they have
found it and are ready for another.&nbsp; The boats which take
the passengers on shore are large, and manned by four or five men
dressed in blue cotton.&nbsp; The charge is a shilling each
way.&nbsp; The landing is easy enough, but in this hot climate I
question whether a visit repays the trouble.&nbsp; Most of the
passengers, however, seem to <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>be of a contrary opinion; nor is that
to be wondered at when I state that many of them are
ladies&mdash;or in other words, true daughters of Eve.&nbsp; They
drive out to the tanks, and come back with headache and ears
aching as well.&nbsp; In the meanwhile the row on board is
incessant, as the wild Arabs of the sea scream for coins and
perform all sorts of wonderful tricks in the way of diving.&nbsp;
From the deck the scene is interesting and animated.&nbsp; Aden,
with its brown rocks, is on our right: and ahead and on the other
side of the bay runs the yellow sand, terminating&mdash;as
everything does, apparently, on this rugged coast&mdash;in a peak
of rocks.&nbsp; It is only the rock that belongs to us, and what
we see are the offices of the company and the residence of the
officials.&nbsp; The town is a terrible place to live in.&nbsp;
On your way to the old town you meet endless strings of camels
with the produce of the country, as in Aden itself not a blade of
grass grows.&nbsp; The harbour is alive with ships, and
steam-tugs towing the barges laden with coal, and native
boats.&nbsp; Over the water seagulls and a bigger bird,
apparently a kind of hawk, fly ceaselessly in search of their
prey, and beneath sharks abound, as a white man would soon find
to his cost were he to attempt a swim.&nbsp; Apparently the shark
prefers the white man to the black, and there I and the shark
agree.&nbsp; Away from Aden, <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>which looks charming in the warm
light of the setting sun, we pass out to the Indian Ocean, and
the transition is a relief, as we leave behind the perpetual
jabber of the natives of that fortunate district&mdash;I write
fortunate advisedly, for the English spend a mint of money there,
and the natives, to their credit be it written, know how to
charge.&nbsp; In one particular case which came under my
knowledge &pound;2 was asked for an article for which ultimately
the seller was content with 2s.&nbsp; We were to have had an
addition to our live cargo in the shape of a smart little lad,
whom an Australian had engaged to accompany him.&nbsp; The father
was willing, but the brother, a fine-looking darkey, objected,
and the boy was taken off again, apparently much against his
will.&nbsp; I am told that many of these lads are taken
away&mdash;they are apprenticed to the white man for a term of
three years, the white employer agreeing to pay &pound;12 a year
in the shape of wages.&nbsp; As boys, they seem as active as
monkeys.&nbsp; Whilst I was watching, one of them had his boat
filled with water.&nbsp; In a moment he was out, and, rocking the
boat till it was free from water, he paddled away with his one
oar as if an upset in the water was an everyday occurrence; and
the men seemed as agile as the boys&mdash;tall and muscular, with
long arms and legs, and without an <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>ounce of spare flesh.&nbsp; I fear by
the side of them our Thames watermen would have but a poor
chance.</p>
<p>Our captain tells me he can take a holiday now for the next
few days.&nbsp; Out on the broad expanse of the Indian Ocean we
are away from sunken rocks and coral reefs.&nbsp; According to
Mr. Froude, when he made his way to Australia, he seems to have
got through a good deal of Greek and Latin.&nbsp; In this
delicious climate study of any kind seems quite out of place; but
the sea air makes one hungry and indolent.&nbsp; We live well,
and we have a library, which yields me a novel a day&mdash;of
course I skip the descriptive parts and the sentimental&mdash;and
as we rush over the blue sea, a cooling breeze meets us, and it
is enough to live.&nbsp; I feel as if I were Ulysses and
Christopher Columbus and Captain Cook rolled into one.&nbsp; We
see no land, no ships, no birds in the heavens above, no fish in
the water beneath.&nbsp; Night comes with its clear stars and its
dark waves, and our pace is still the same.&nbsp; It is very
wonderful, and none the less so that it is a wonder of everyday
occurrence.&nbsp; Over the ship, in all parts, we have a perfect
blaze of light&mdash;nine miles of electric wire! and outside all
is darkness and mystery&mdash;a darkness and a mystery man has
learned to master.&nbsp; Science <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>has done that much for him.&nbsp;
Will science unveil the darkness and mystery of being in a
similar manner?&nbsp; I fear not.&nbsp; Happily there is a
Judge</p>

Extortioners&mdash;Buddhist Temple&mdash;Life in the
Streets&mdash;On the Indian Ocean&mdash;Stormy Seas guard
Australia&mdash;English Coolness&mdash;Western Australia.</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">scene</span> of Oriental loveliness
opens on my dazzled eyes this morning.&nbsp; On my right is a
fine breakwater, with a lighthouse at the end, which altogether
cost &pound;650,000, and the building of which occupied ten
years.&nbsp; In front of me is the port of Colombo, filled with
shipping from every quarter of the world.&nbsp; On my left is a
long row of cocoa-palms, looking refreshing and green after the
weary waste of waters we have travelled over.&nbsp; As I write
the catamarans of Ceylon begin to crowd around.&nbsp; They are
long, narrow boats&mdash;a stout Englishman would find it hard to
sit in one of them&mdash;rowed by dusky sailors, with long oars,
many of which seem to terminate in a sort of spade.&nbsp; The men
are naked, with the exception of a cloth <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>round the
loins, and are apparently strong and sinewy.&nbsp; A few feet off
is the outrigger, so formed that the boat never upsets.&nbsp;
They may be useful, these boats, but have an awkward appearance
to an English eye.&nbsp; They bring on board the men who have
come to fetch the washing for the passengers, which will all be
finished and on board before we leave.&nbsp; Then come the
tailors, who will measure you for a suit of white, which will
also be finished ere we depart.&nbsp; Then come the barges with
the coal, and I get into a tug and go on shore.&nbsp; We all do
it, for the <i>Orizaba</i> is unbearable while the coal is being
put on board.</p>
<p>It is strange to remember that at one time Colombo was so far
off, that the news of her Majesty&rsquo;s accession to the crown,
which occurred on June 20, 1833, did not reach Colombo till some
immense time after.&nbsp; Ceylon was between ninety and a hundred
days from England, now it is only eighteen.&nbsp; Long after
Lieutenant Waghorn had opened up the overland route, her
Majesty&rsquo;s Government with characteristic stupidity still
continued to send the mails by the Cape of Good Hope.&nbsp; It
was left to the opening of the Suez Canal to render Ceylon easy
of access, and to render it possible for English men and women to
live there with comfort and luxury, in my humble opinion, far <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>superior to
anything we have at home, and Ceylon is redolent of prosperity,
whether we regard its population, its revenue, or its
trade.&nbsp; Directly the traveller lands at Colombo he feels as
if in an enchanted isle.</p>
<p>As soon as you land in Colombo you are in India, and in,
perhaps, its most attractive part.&nbsp; There are some 130,000
people in the city, all mild and gentle, and well-behaved.&nbsp;
At once you are attracted by the grand Oriental Hotel, which
faces the port; you pass on a few steps, and come to lofty shops,
filled with all the dazzling products of the East, with gardens
in the rear, and it is hard to avoid being taken in, for the
swarthy shopkeepers are clamorous, and, in the matter of
cheating, quite the equal of the Heathen Chinee.&nbsp; A friend
of mine purchases a white sapphire, as it is called, for
eighteenpence, for which the owner asked four pounds, and I much
fear my friend has been victimized after all.&nbsp; An
unfortunate gentleman shows me a gold ring for which more than
three pounds was paid, and which turns out not to be worth a
halfpenny.&nbsp; But it is too hot to walk and I hire a carriage,
and, with a companion, take a ride of a couple of hours for the
small charge of three shillings.&nbsp; We start for the Buddhist
temple, a whitewashed building about a couple of miles off.&nbsp;
Externally there is little to see.&nbsp; It stands in a green
court, surrounded by white walls, <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and the schoolmaster, after we have
dropped a shilling into the box, and given him a trifle for
himself, takes us round.&nbsp; The place consists of three
courts, but the light is bad, and the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
English very defective, and I came back little wiser than when I
entered.&nbsp; The things that principally impressed me were a
recumbent gigantic image of Buddha, a court in which there were
seventy-five painted images of Buddha, and a smaller one in
alabaster, and a long wall covered with representations of
Buddhist legends which the schoolmaster, alas! did not condescend
to explain.&nbsp; The Buddhist temple is small, and the only sign
of its being used are the flowers scattered before the images,
the offerings of his followers.&nbsp; The Christians, at any
rate, make a good show as far as buildings are concerned, the
Church of England heading the list with Christ Church Cathedral
and nine other churches.&nbsp; The Presbyterians have two, the
Wesleyans six, the Baptists one, the handsomest place of worship
in the town, to say nothing of the Salvation Army, which has also
a station here.&nbsp; Some people argue that Buddhism is such an
exalted form of worship that we ought not to interfere with the
faith of the people.&nbsp; That, however, is not the feeling of
the whites in Ceylon, who know Buddhism best.&nbsp; To myself,
with all my sympathy for Buddhism, the <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Buddhist temple seemed a very poor
affair.&nbsp; I should have said there are also many Mohammedans,
and their mosques are numerous.</p>
<p>The streets are an endless delight, as you pass ladies riding
in little hooded chairs on wheels, drawn by men; or swells,
native or English, in broughams with latticed sides, so as to
admit the breeze; and cars, rather rickety, drawn by native
ponies and driven by native drivers, whom you may trust to take
you to all the objects of interest to be seen, such as the
hotels, the gardens, the museum, etc.&nbsp; Then there are native
waggons, thatched with dried leaves, and drawn by little
dun-coloured bulls with humps on their backs&mdash;active
animals, which trot along with a swiftness of which a Sussex
farmer, who still ploughs with oxen as his fathers before him,
can have no idea.&nbsp; Under the trees you see the natives
sitting over their dirty rice, which they still eat with unwashed
hands.&nbsp; Where the natives live the population is almost as
dense as in the East-end of London; and as to the pickaninnies,
they are everywhere, with their little curly heads, sparkling
eyes, and half-naked bodies, their mothers, in coloured dresses,
leaving them pretty much to take care of themselves.&nbsp; Boys
and girls run after us all the way with flowers, or bright
beetles, or packets of cinnamon and other woods.&nbsp; All is
strange, <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>and all is attractive&mdash;the gorgeous butterflies
that flit in the sun, the crowded streets, the native dwellings,
with a screen of lath, which apparently does duty for a door; the
tempting bungalows, standing in the midst of gardens with
Oriental flowers, or under the shade of palm-trees, of which we
in England can only dream; the grand promenades, where the
residents walk of an evening to catch the refreshing sea-breeze;
and the handsome parks, where English bands play English airs to
the delighted crowds.&nbsp; The town is prosperous,
undoubtedly.&nbsp; There are fine English barracks, and
England&rsquo;s martial sons are to be met with everywhere.&nbsp;
The whole island prospers under English rule.&nbsp;
Ceylon&rsquo;s staple products&mdash;tea, coffee, and
cinchona&mdash;employ hundreds of men, women, and children of
different classes, and now an attempt is being made to introduce
fish-curing.&nbsp; I could almost envy Arabi his place of
banishment.&nbsp; I felt inclined to say with the poet, if there
be an Elysium on earth, it is this; but then I was there in the
cool time of year, when life is enjoyable, and when even the
white man has a little of his native colour left.&nbsp; Yet even
enchanting Colombo (I did not realize Heber&rsquo;s
Ceylon&rsquo;s spicy breezes, quite the reverse, but perhaps that
was my misfortune rather than my fault) has its drawbacks.&nbsp;
As I am standing opposite the hotel, a <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>native approaches with a small
basket.&nbsp; He puts the basket on the ground and begins to
pipe.&nbsp; To my horror, as he does so, a hooded cobra, lying
<i>perdu</i>, with its black eyes and silver hood, erects itself
on its tail as if ready to dart on its prey.&nbsp; Now, as above
all things I hate snakes, and cobras most of all, I fled the spot
and at once made for the tug, leaving the native juggler, I doubt
not, not a little astonished at my want of taste.</p>
<p>Life on the ocean wave is really to be enjoyed on the Indian
Ocean&mdash;an immense water, pleasanter to look at and sail on
than the Atlantic, of which no one is sure, and which is variable
as woman herself.&nbsp; It is impossible to overrate the beauty
of the azure waves and skies which greet us every day.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, we may have too much of a good thing, and no one
regrets that we are approaching the end of our journey.&nbsp; At
church on Sunday it seemed to me that we are much given to the
use of misleading language.&nbsp; It was announced that the
bishop would hold divine service, and perhaps he did so; at any
rate, the assembly was numerous, and in appearance devout; but I
missed the firemen who kept up the steam, the men on the outlook,
the steersman on the bridge, and the inmates of the room set
apart for the due study of charts.&nbsp; Were they not engaged in
a service equally divine?</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>How,
one by one, vanish the illusions of youth!&nbsp; Yesterday I
would have sworn mangoes were delicious eating, for I have read
so a thousand times; but to-day I have discovered the
much-talked-of mango to be an impostor, in shape like a potato,
with a great stone inside, only to be thrown away.&nbsp; Then
what raptures we hear about the Southern Cross!&nbsp; I have seen
it and it charms no longer, and the beauty of it is that the
Australians who most rejoice in it seem utterly unable to tell
you in what part of the heavens it shines.&nbsp; Then take the
tropics.&nbsp; What descriptions one reads of tropical heats:
heats fraught with deadly fever&mdash;heats so intense that an
old man may well shrink from the danger of encountering
them!&nbsp; I have been now nearly a week in the tropics, and
they are really delightful.&nbsp; It is true you are warm; it is
true that when the ports are closed by night the atmosphere in
the cabin is apt to be unpleasant&mdash;but then that is of rare
occurrence&mdash;and the tropics, I hold, so far from deserving
to be run down, are favourably to be compared with London fogs
and cold.&nbsp; We have now crossed the line, and have sailed for
days along the Indian Ocean.&nbsp; Not a drop of rain has fallen
on the deck, not a touch of bronchitis is to be met with in
anyone aboard, not a ripple is to be seen on the great blue plain
of the sea save that <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>made by the <i>Orizaba</i> as she
ploughs her majestic way at the rate of 320 miles a day.&nbsp; I
should say, as far as my experience goes, any elderly man or
woman, who in London suffers from its uncertain climate, would
find the atmosphere of the Indian Ocean an immense change for the
better.&nbsp; If any such require a real sanatorium, I would
conscientiously recommend them a trip to Australia and back, if
they can stand the sea, and if they have the good luck to secure
a berth in such a ship as the <i>Orizaba</i>.&nbsp; By all means
let them have a chair; I did not take one, as I thought it would
not be worth the trouble, and even at Naples, when an ex-M.P. who
went ashore there kindly offered me his chair as a parting gift,
I had not sense enough to avail myself of the offer; but I have
regretted it ever since.&nbsp; People who have chairs put them in
the best places, where the breeze is most grateful, and thus
enjoy a great advantage over those who can do nothing of the
kind.&nbsp; By all means also let the tourist have a white dress;
it is the only kind of dress to be tolerated on the Indian Ocean,
and, of course, he must have canvas shoes, which he will find the
more useful if they are soled with indiarubber rather than
leather.&nbsp; You are bound to take as much exercise as you can,
and it is not pleasant to fall on a slippery deck.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Let the
intending traveller choose, if he can, his time.&nbsp; Between
November and March the ocean is delightful.&nbsp; If, however, it
is entered between May and September, when the thick weather and
fierce winds of the south-west monsoon prevail, it is very much
the reverse.&nbsp; It is a run of more than 3,000 miles from
Colombo to Cape Leeuwin, the south-west point of Australia, and
this is the most monotonous part of the journey, as there is
nothing to be seen on the sea.&nbsp; We only met two ships after
leaving Colombo, and people grow sleepy and dull, and the
conversation, at no time brilliant, rather flags.&nbsp; One can
scarcely imagine what the horror of the passage was in not very
remote times.&nbsp; When the bishop first went, he tells me, it
was in a sailing vessel, and they were three months on the
voyage, revelling on salt pork and beef all the while.&nbsp; Our
modern bishops don&rsquo;t care much for that sort of diet, nor,
if I may judge by the way we live, their flocks either, and this,
by the way, is the real difficulty and danger on
ship-board.&nbsp; As a rule, people are ill because they eat and
drink too much.&nbsp; I have been a teetotaler all the while and
have tried to eat as little as I could, and hence I am at any
rate as well as anyone aboard.&nbsp; Again, let me caution the
traveller to avoid a ship that rolls.&nbsp; In this respect we
are wonderfully fortunate.&nbsp; The <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span><i>Orizaba</i> never rolls, and in
the worst weather we dine in comfort, no crockery is smashed, and
no steward spills a drop of soup.&nbsp; In the dark watches of
the night it is the rolling that keeps passengers wide awake, and
if ships can be built like ours it is a shame to send people on
such long voyages in any others.&nbsp; In the tropics the clouds
that come up as the fiery sun sinks into the blue sea are awful,
darker and more threatening than any I have seen elsewhere.&nbsp;
Then they disappear, and then again reappear, to fly with the
early dawn.&nbsp; It is a long time before one can be reconciled
to their grandeur.&nbsp; I am not surprised that people feel
timid.&nbsp; There is a good deal to make people nervous at
sea.&nbsp; A lady passenger tells me that when she goes to bed in
rough weather, every night she expects to go to the bottom.&nbsp;
I gave her what comfort I could; but then, as Festus grandly
tells us, we live by heart-throbs not by years, and so the poor
woman is to be pitied after all.</p>
<p>Not in summer calm, not when the gentleness of heaven is on
the sea, do we approach the Australian coast.&nbsp; The garden of
the Hesperides was guarded by dragons; and approach the
Australian continent, for such it really is, which way you will,
you find her defended by winds that are ever howling and seas
that never are at rest.&nbsp; They did their best to frighten <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>us as we made
for the point where first we greet the granite rocks of the Land
of the Golden Fleece; of course, there is no danger, and everyone
pretends to enjoy it.&nbsp; As to myself, I frankly own&mdash;in
spite of Byron and dear old Captain Basil Hall, whose pictures of
sea-life, when I was in jackets, made everyone long to be a
sailor&mdash;that I prefer calm to storm, and that never do I
love the ocean so much as when it has ceased to roar.&nbsp; There
are people who feel otherwise, just as there are people who enjoy
the bagpipes, but they are the exception rather than the
rule.&nbsp; It may be that the danger is little, but the motion
of any ship on a stormy sea is unpleasant.&nbsp; It is to be
questioned, however, whether there is any other sea-voyage so
long, and at the same time attended with so little inconvenience,
as this Australian trip, and I can quite understand how ready the
Australians are to run &lsquo;home,&rsquo; as they call it.&nbsp;
They love Old England to the very bottom of their hearts.&nbsp;
Some of them are quite ready to return and leave their bones
amongst us.&nbsp; But we drive them away.&nbsp; One of my
companions, for instance, has been spending a few weeks in
London.&nbsp; He is a lawyer, and has made a lot of money, gotten
chiefly at Ballarat in the good old times, when, instead of the
ordinary six-and-eight, he always pocketed a fiver.&nbsp; It was
his intention to have bought an estate <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and settled in England; but then it
occurred to him that if he did no one would ever come to see
him&mdash;at any rate, such was the universal testimony of those
of his friends who had settled down in the old country, one of
them a gentleman who had done the State some service and who had
been presented at Court; and so my friend returns to
Australia&mdash;swearing he will never go to London
again&mdash;where he seems to have spent his money like a
Nabob.&nbsp; Another complaint which I hear in many quarters is
that Englishmen are ungrateful.&nbsp; One gentleman tells me how
he had exerted himself on behalf of a young lad who had come out
to Melbourne friendless, did all he could for him, treated him,
in fact, as his own son, even had a gushing letter of thanks and
gratitude from the mother, and yet when he called upon her in
London she did not take the slightest notice of him; and in
another case, where he introduced himself to the father of two
young men to whom he had been the means of rendering much
assistance, and to whom he had extended the utmost hospitality,
all he received was a formal invitation to call when that way,
and that only after he had met the grateful parent twice in the
streets of the county town near which he lived.&nbsp; Colonials
who have been hospitable to English visitors naturally expect a
return of hospitality when they find <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>themselves strangers in a strange
land; and Englishmen should remember that it is at all times a
duty to perpetuate the traditions of old English hospitality, and
to take in the stranger in the Scriptural rather than in the
modern way.</p>
<p>At length I have seen an albatross, and that may be taken as
an indication that we are getting near our journey&rsquo;s
end.&nbsp; It is a large bird, as big almost as a turkey, with
white body and dark wings, but not often to be seen at this
season of the year.&nbsp; For awhile we skirted the Australian
coast, and dropped some thirty passengers for Western Australia
at Albany, its chief port.&nbsp; They were sent ashore in a tug
in rather a primitive fashion, and we had plenty of time to
admire the magnificent harbour surrounded by granite rocks,
enclosing a wide expanse of water, which we enter between two
rocks, on one of which is a lighthouse.&nbsp; Of human
habitations we saw nothing save one or two on the brow of a hill,
at the bottom of which has been built a long railway pier, which
railway, as it is not complete, is only used once a week, when
the steamers arrive, for the purpose of conveying mails and
passengers to Perth.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose the first port you
touched at was Perth?&rsquo; said an English M.P. and
distinguished educationalist to me.&nbsp; Alas! it would have
been hard work to have <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>taken the <i>Orizaba</i> to
Perth.&nbsp; Perth is the capital of a country eight times as
large as the United Kingdom, which is at present a Crown colony,
but which is to be made directly the home of a self-governing
community.&nbsp; We dropped at Albany a young man who has been
sheep-farming there for fifteen years, and is quite satisfied
with the result.&nbsp; You could hardly credit how many thousand
acres he has hired of the Government at a rental of 10s. a
thousand acres.&nbsp; He has no white neighbours, and his
labourers are chiefly native blacks, with whom, he tells me, he
gets on very well.&nbsp; The country, he says, is well fitted for
agricultural purposes, and there is plenty of good land to be
bought at 10s. an acre.&nbsp; Hitherto the difficulty has been
how to dispose of the produce, but that will shortly cease, as
the district is now being opened up by railways, and from all
that I can hear it is just the country for the British farmer who
feels inclined to clear off before he has lost his last farthing
in the vain attempt to compete with the foreign producer.&nbsp;
In Western Australia, with a little capital, he may certainly do
well.&nbsp; Everyone says Western Australia is the country of the
future.&nbsp; As to Albany itself, it is growing rapidly, and has
a population now of about 2,000.&nbsp; It seems to me prettily
situated, and already people who have made <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>a little
money have fixed upon it as their residence.&nbsp; There are
Church of England, Wesleyan, and Presbyterian churches there, and
it boasts a paper&mdash;published weekly for threepence, and dear
at the money&mdash;which found a large sale on board, for the
sake mainly of its meagre telegraphic intelligence relating to
English and European affairs.&nbsp; After the dreary monotony of
the sea it was pleasant to look on the hills which hid Albany and
its surrounding district from the vulgar gaze.&nbsp; On one hill
there was a long trail of smoke, which indicated that somewhere
there was a large bush fire; and climbing up the sides of all was
a scanty undergrowth, which if good for neither man nor beast,
had an appearance of verdure, which, to the eye, seemed a living
green, now and then varied by stretches of yellow or white sand;
and behind, though not visible to us from the deck of the
steamer, stretched a forest, full of a black wood which makes the
finest railway-sleepers in the world.&nbsp; On the whole, it may
be said Western Australia is bound to go ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stranger who makes his first
trip to Australia is not a little astonished by the extreme cold
which greets him as he nears his destination.&nbsp; You hear so
much of Australian heat that you are not a little astonished to
find the nearer you get to your journey&rsquo;s end the colder it
becomes.&nbsp; In the tropics we had all given up warm clothing,
but as we reached Western Australia great-coats by day and
blankets by night came into fashion.&nbsp; People were wrapped up
as if we were on the coast of England rather than of Australia,
and as to sleeping with the ports open, that was quite <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>out of the
question.&nbsp; This is an admirable provision of Nature.&nbsp;
It gives us the advantage of having the body braced up before it
encounters the formidable heat which, according to all accounts,
awaits us on shore.&nbsp; Another thing that strikes a stranger,
as he studies the papers from all parts of the country, is the
extraordinary difference in the weather as recorded in different
localities.&nbsp; For instance, I find at Sydney the weather is
described as delightfully cool, while at Adelaide on the same day
it is recorded as the hottest of the season.&nbsp; In one
district I read how the rain has come down in a perfect deluge,
whilst in another men and vegetables are dying from the want of
water.&nbsp; At a town in Queensland, the heat is so intense that
many are dying daily of sunstrokes, and the insurance agents have
been telegraphed to not to effect any more insurances, whilst in
another locality I read of a heavy fall of snow.&nbsp; The fact
is, it is impossible to realize the size of the Australian
continent, twenty-six times larger than Great Britain and
Ireland, or the various kinds of weather to be met with, till you
are on the continent itself.</p>
<p>A pleasant trip of a day and a half from Adelaide, most of
which time was passed in sight of land, enabled us to reach
Melbourne&mdash;marvellous Melbourne, as it has been
called&mdash;in time to go on board <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the <i>Lusitania</i> and bid good-bye
to Miss von Finkelstein, who is, she tells me, wonderfully
delighted with her Australian trip, and intends returning
again.&nbsp; She goes now as far as Port Said, and thence she
makes her way to Jerusalem.&nbsp; I then get into the train, and
after a run of half an hour along a flat district, partly waste
and partly built over with little wooden villas&mdash;prettily
painted, each with its tiny garden, which seemed to me to have a
wonderful knack of getting burnt down every night&mdash;find
myself landed in the noble thoroughfare, which seems to me to run
from one end of the city to the other, known as Collins Street;
and almost the first person I meet&mdash;at any rate, the first
one I recognise&mdash;is Dr. Hannay, who is leaving by the next
mail steamer, and who is looking very well, though he tells me he
has been much tried by the great heat of the last
fortnight.&nbsp; The dust and the sun are trying, and I get back
to the ship for dinner.</p>
<p>When next I go on shore it is Sunday morning, and a grateful
breeze awaits me as I make my way along picturesque and stately
Collins Street&mdash;a street which would be an ornament to
London itself.&nbsp; The public-houses are closed, the tramcars
have ceased running, and the busy crowds that block up the
footways on the week-day are away.&nbsp; Instead of them <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>there are the
church-goers&mdash;well-dressed, sedate, orderly&mdash;just as we
may see anywhere in England on the Sabbath.&nbsp; And if I miss
the sound of the church-going bell, I know not that that is an
unmitigated loss&mdash;indeed, as far as London is concerned in
that respect, it always seems to me that we may have too much of
a good thing.&nbsp; On my left I pass a handsome Baptist Church,
which was crammed to suffocation when a short time since Rev. Dr.
Maclaren, of Manchester, was preaching.&nbsp; Further on I pass
the fine Scots Church, and on the other side of the crossing is
the noble church of which Dr. Bevan is the popular pastor, and
where I tarry to admire the cool and spacious structure, the
appearance of the people, and the eloquence of the
preacher.&nbsp; It is the premier church of Victoria, and is in
every way worthy of its position.&nbsp; The people rejoice in an
endowment of &pound;3,700 a year, all of which is turned to good
purposes, and they give at the doors as much as &pound;1,500 a
year, to say nothing of pew rents.&nbsp; It is not in Victoria
that you feel doubts as to the power of the Churches to
evangelize the land.&nbsp; Here, as all over the colonies, the
Church of England leads the way, and&mdash;as was to be expected
when you remember what an adventurous race of men the Scotch
are&mdash;the Presbyterians occupy the second place.&nbsp; The
Wesleyans and the Congregationalists <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>come next, and of the latter body Dr.
Bevan is the leader, and he seems to me to enjoy his position to
the utmost.&nbsp; He is the picture of health and happiness, and,
as I tell him, is to be likened rather to a wealthy archdeacon at
home than to a Congregational minister, as we know him, in a
country where he has to take&mdash;thanks to Parliamentary
wisdom&mdash;rather a place in the second rank.&nbsp; He and Mrs.
Bevan alike seem to have renewed their youth in this far-off
land.&nbsp; A dealer in portraits of English celebrities,
by-the-bye, tells me that people often ask him if the portrait of
John Bright he displays is not that of the worthy Doctor.&nbsp;
And, indeed, there is a breadth and vigour in the Doctor&rsquo;s
sermons which naturally suggests to the hearer the fiery
eloquence of John Bright.&nbsp; Standing in his gown, on his
platform pulpit, the Doctor certainly carries all before
him.&nbsp; His audience seems to be wielded at his will, and his
audience is a noble one; men and women to whom the service of the
sanctuary is not a form or conventional observance or symbol of
respectability, but a joy and delight, which reminds one of what
church-going was, in what to sceptical and scientific London
seems a far-off time, when Dr. Watts could write:</p>
<blockquote><p>At once they sing, at once they pray,<br />
They hear of heaven and learn the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>What
strikes me as a contrast to congregations I know nearer home is
the power of the audience.&nbsp; The people are in the prime of
life, not decayed and elderly, and the proportion of young men is
great.&nbsp; In the evening they make a grand show in the
gallery&mdash;semi-circular, lofty, and airy.&nbsp; And this is,
remember, the summer season, when families rush off to the
seaside, and corresponds to the period when in London our
churches are thin, and when in New York and Washington, and the
other great centres of American life and energy, it is usual for
the pastor to shut up his church, and for the people to give
themselves a Sunday rest&mdash;not in the Jewish, but in the
modern acceptation of that term.&nbsp; In the afternoon I enjoyed
the hospitality of one of the Doctor&rsquo;s deacons, Mr.
Johnson, who has had the honour of making his handsome house the
temporary residence of Mr. Henry Lee, who is away preaching.</p>
<p>In every direction I look I see capacious streets with
handsome houses, all painted white, and broad streets which are
lined for miles with the dwellings of the Melbournites, while as
you wander in wonder, every now and then, beyond the glitter of
the white houses, and the green foliage of the public gardens,
you see a thin silver streak of the blue bay.&nbsp; In the
evening, the Doctor will have me go home with him.&nbsp; <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>We stop late,
for there are people waiting to see the Doctor in his private
vestry; then we catch the last tram to Camberwell&mdash;how funny
the old name seems to us on this Australian soil!&nbsp; Then we
are driven home by the Doctor&rsquo;s Jehu&mdash;who, I fancy,
has rather a good time of it, though, as a Roman Catholic, he
holds his master to be a heretic&mdash;and we have a welcome
supper in a veritable bungalow, large, and occupying its own
grounds of thirty acres, devoted by the Doctor to farming, on an
interesting, but, I fear, rather unprofitable, scale.&nbsp; At an
early hour on Monday morning&mdash;for we have much to talk of
over our cigars, uncommonly fine ones, a present to the
Doctor&mdash;I am offered a choice of beds, of course all on the
ground-floor.&nbsp; I resolved to sleep in the one which has
recently been tenanted by Dr. Hannay, of whom everyone in
Melbourne speaks well.&nbsp; As the Doctor shows me to my bed and
shuts down the window, I am idiot enough to say, &lsquo;Any
snakes about here, Doctor?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Only a few black
ones now and then,&rsquo; he replies, in a light and airy
way.&nbsp; But, alas! the Doctor&rsquo;s words kept me uncommonly
wide awake that night.</p>
<p>One of the sights of Melbourne, the most marvellous I have yet
seen, is that known as &lsquo;Cole&rsquo;s Book Arcade,&rsquo; in
Bourke Street, which is not merely a <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>place for the dissemination of
knowledge, useful or otherwise, but a reading-room as well, into
which thousands enter, pick up a book, take a seat, and read as
long as they like without spending a farthing.&nbsp; Mr. Cole
himself, the owner, is a remarkable man.&nbsp; He hails from
Ashford, in Kent, and had been some time in the colony trying to
make a fortune, but with little success, and now evidently he
has, to borrow an Americanism, &lsquo;struck ile.&rsquo;&nbsp; As
a compiler he has done some good work.&nbsp; His aim is to
publish the Library of the Future, to be composed entirely of the
cream of human thought and knowledge.&nbsp; To this scheme he
gives the title of &lsquo;The Federation of the World&rsquo;s
Library.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is to consist of one hundred of the best
books in the world; one book, the best of its kind, is to be on
astronomy, another on geology, another on geography, and so
on.&nbsp; Each book is to be complete of its kind, and highly
condensed.&nbsp; It is easily and perfectly done, he says.&nbsp;
A moderate-sized song-book, he tells us, holds all the best songs
in the world; a moderate-sized wisdom-book&mdash;it is a
humiliating reflection&mdash;will hold all the wisest sayings in
the world; a moderate-sized book, carefully prepared, of
astronomy, geology, chemistry, botany, or any of the sciences,
will give a clear knowledge of the principles of each.&nbsp; Such
a <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>library,
of 100 volumes of 600 pages each, can be produced to sell at
&pound;10, thus bringing all the most important knowledge and all
the most beautiful thoughts within the reach of every human
being.&nbsp; He calculates that there are a million printed poems
in the world.&nbsp; The 1,000 best are worth the remaining
999,000 all put together.&nbsp; Probably out of the 1,000 best
there are 100 first-class, 300 second-class, and 600
third-class.&nbsp; Amongst the first-class Mr. Cole reckons
Gray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Elegy,&rsquo; Goldsmith&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Deserted Village,&rsquo; and Longfellow&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Psalm of Life.&rsquo;&nbsp; As a bookseller he
asserts&mdash;and I am sorry to write it&mdash;that it is read
more, verse for verse, than the whole of Milton&rsquo;s and
Homer&rsquo;s poems put together.&nbsp; Mr. Cole tells me that,
with the exception of school books&mdash;always in
demand&mdash;his principal sales are novels and theological
works.&nbsp; Of the latter he sells most of Talmage.&nbsp; Ward
Beecher does not go down so well.&nbsp; Perhaps the Australians
in this respect resemble some of the members of the Christian
Young Men&rsquo;s Association.&nbsp; When last in London, Mr.
Cole went to hear the great American lecture at Exeter
Hall.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Beecher ought not to be allowed to lecture
here,&rsquo; said someone to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why so?&rsquo;
asked Mr. Cole.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because he is an infidel,&rsquo; was
the charitable reply.</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>And
what a sight Mr. Cole&rsquo;s shop is, to be sure! especially at
business hours, when it swarms with buyers and readers.&nbsp; It
is three stories high, 200 feet deep, and 40 feet wide.&nbsp; Its
walks are a third of a mile long, and its capacious galleries are
supported by 140 brass pillars.&nbsp; The sign of the
establishment is the rainbow, which is to be seen painted
everywhere.&nbsp; A gorgeous rainbow ornaments the chief entrance
in Bourke Street.&nbsp; Inside daily may be seen hundreds of men,
women, and children, who really seem more numerous than they are
in consequence of the seventy mirrors with which the interior is
decorated.&nbsp; There are twenty miles of boards in the
shelving, and 2,800 large cedar drawers.&nbsp; Altogether there
are 100,000 sorts of books, all well classified, so that the
purchaser can at once secure what he requires, and if he wants a
selection he has probably a million of books to choose
from.&nbsp; New books, music, and stationery occupy the
ground-floor, second-hand books the next floor, and on the top
floor is a fine collection of china, glass, and other house
ornaments and knick-knacks.&nbsp; This flat is entirely devoted
to the sale of goods to beautify the interiors of houses, as
books beautify the mental interiors of their readers.&nbsp; If
you want to get to the top, and you are too tired and weary to
walk, <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>there is a handsomely-decorated lift at your service,
and if you require the solace of music there are free
performances given every afternoon and evening.&nbsp; Mr. Cole,
to his credit be it said, has prohibited, as far as he is
concerned, the sale of Zola&rsquo;s novels, having struck them
out of his list.&nbsp; I asked one of his <i>employ&eacute;s</i>
to what religious body he belonged.&nbsp; I was amused with this
reply: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but he&rsquo;s a very good
man.&nbsp; I expect he is a Dissenter.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is curious
to find people who do not go to Episcopalian churches spoken of
as Dissenters in a land where there is no State Church, and where
all denominations are on an equality; but then this particular
young man had only left the Old Country a year and a half, and
had not got rid of his Old World ideas.&nbsp; As an illustration
of the value of property in Melbourne, Mr. Cole tells me that his
rent is &pound;1,000 a year, that he has a lease of it for
fifteen years, and that the proprietor nevertheless had had an
offer made him for the place of &pound;5,000 a year.&nbsp; All
round Mr. Cole&rsquo;s premises are what he calls intellect
sharpeners, in the shape of extracts from what wise men have
written in favour of study and reading.&nbsp; This Australian
Cole seems in his way to do much to advance Australia.</p>
<p>One of the few places in Australia to which interesting <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>associations
attach is Sorrento, and it is one of the places most patronised
by the Melbourne public.&nbsp; You leave Melbourne Port at
half-past eleven, and you arrive there at two.&nbsp; As the
steamer returns at half-past three, you have not much time for
exploration, and in my own case I admit that time was curtailed
from perfectly natural causes.&nbsp; As I landed, the
announcement &lsquo;hot dinners&rsquo; met my eye, and gave me
quite an appetite.&nbsp; I walked up the cliff, found a
comfortable and airy hotel at the top, and did justice to a good
half-crown dinner.&nbsp; Nor was I singular.&nbsp; I found many
of my travelling companions similarly disposed.&nbsp; One must
dine, and you may as well dine in comfort as not.</p>
<p>Everyone in Melbourne goes to Sorrento.&nbsp; I was in the
former city on one of the days when the heat is tropical, when
the hot wind and the dust are intolerable, when everyone in the
city looks parched and weary; while the wives and mothers and
daughters at home draw down the blinds, fasten all the doors to
keep the hot air out, and sit metaphorically in dust and
ashes.&nbsp; In vain are scanty attire and cooling drinks; in
vain are all the resources of human ingenuity.&nbsp; The only
thing to do is to take the train to Melbourne Port, and then get
on board the steamer for Sorrento, where the temperature is
always twenty <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>degrees lower than in Melbourne.&nbsp; The wind blows
straight from Port Melbourne to the Heads; it has no heated land
to pass over on its way to Sorrento, and arrives there cool and
bracing from its contact with the salt water.&nbsp; On one side
we have the Bay, and on the other side the Southern Ocean, only a
narrow mile of land dividing them.&nbsp; It has a charming
locality all round, picturesque cliffs, and the sea.&nbsp; Traces
of the old settlement are visible still.&nbsp; One of the
original wells sunk in 1803 has been opened for the use of the
public, and the shade of the scrub gives special advantage to
picnic parties, for which the whole picturesque extent of country
round is admirably adapted.&nbsp; It was here came the original
settlers.&nbsp; One of the oldest, just carried to his last long
home, used to tell terrible stories of them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Had you
any trouble with the natives in those days?&rsquo; asked an
anxious inquirer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Trouble!&rsquo; was the reply;
&lsquo;not me, poor things.&nbsp; Why, sir, they were as harmless
as babies.&nbsp; I have seen upwards of a thousand on &rsquo;em
at a corroborree on the Meni creek&mdash;that was their
camping-ground then.&nbsp; Dear, dear, poor things, they&rsquo;re
gone now, sir, gone; most on &rsquo;em shot off, or put out of
the way somehow else.&nbsp; If there is any questions asked when
we are dead and gone, some of our big squatting swells ull have
some <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>awful
posers to answer.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, added the old man,
&lsquo;Take my word for it, sir, the blacks were a harmless,
good-natured lot till the cruelty of the whites made &rsquo;em
bad and revengeful, poor things; and who can blame
&rsquo;em?&rsquo;&nbsp; The flour which they used was mixed with
arsenic, and thus they lost in many cases their lives and
lands.&nbsp; In one case it was certain that a native was shot by
a celebrated <i>savant</i> that he might have possession of the
native&rsquo;s skull.&nbsp; There are few natives left now.&nbsp;
Such humane treatment has somewhat diminished their number.&nbsp;
At all times it was a puzzle what to do with them, as the
following well-authenticated anecdote shows.&nbsp; Two aboriginal
children, separated from babyhood from aboriginal life, were
trained and educated like colonists.&nbsp; In the earlier years
little difference was noted, but as they advanced into boyhood,
some restlessness became apparent.&nbsp; Ultimately, when a
native tribe happened to come near, the children escaped, to
taste once more the charms of savage life.&nbsp; The Australians
employ many of them, and make them useful in many ways, but none
of them rise to anything like a position in the social scale, or
evince any capacity of ever rising to become more than hewers of
wood and drawers of water.&nbsp; I have seen them usefully
engaged at such places as the Point Macleay Mission, in South <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Australia,
but even there I question whether they earn their own
living.&nbsp; On one occasion I crossed Lake Alexandrina in a
sailing-boat managed by blacks, and I was not
drowned&mdash;which, however, does not say much for their
nautical skill, as the lake was as calm as a mill-pond.</p>
<p>But to return to Sorrento.&nbsp; The history of this place
begins with the discovery of the fine harbour of Port Philip by
Lieutenant Murray, a harbour of some forty miles in extent.&nbsp;
The next year it was made the site of a convict settlement under
Governor Collins, who soon had enough of the place, and started
off for Tasmania.&nbsp; Eight convicts were missing within a
month of their arrival.&nbsp; Four were brought back and
punished, one was shot by a constable, and the three others,
oppressed with hunger, after wandering round the western shores
of Port Philip, made fires to attract the attention of their
companions, but without success.&nbsp; Two of them walked back to
surrender themselves into the hands of justice, but were never
heard of after; and for a while the place was left to the
kangaroos and the natives, till there arrived on the scene
Hamilton Hume, a native-born colonist of New South Wales.&nbsp;
In 1834 three gentlemen named Henty established a whaling station
at Portland Bay, and this was the <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>first settlement in Victoria.&nbsp;
At this time, and for some time afterwards, the natives were
easily beguiled.&nbsp; As late as 1835 a John Bateman, of Hobart
Town, landed on the western shore of Port Philip, and entered
into a contract with the natives for 1,000 square miles of
territory for a few blankets to be given them every year.&nbsp;
The Government refused to sanction this iniquitous
transaction.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the natives were despoiled of
their land&mdash;Governor Bourke annexed it in the name of his
Majesty.&nbsp; Melbourne, on the Yarra, was named after the
British Premier of that day, and Williamstown, where the grand
boats of the Orient and P. and O. Companies land and embark their
passengers, had the questionable honour of being named after our
Sailor King.</p>
<p>Port Philip was a place rather given to joviality and
adventure.&nbsp; Ladies and children were rare.&nbsp; There was a
marvellous consumption of brandy.&nbsp; Manners, when visible,
were rough.&nbsp; &lsquo;The town,&rsquo; writes an old settler,
&lsquo;was bad, and the bush was worse.&rsquo;&nbsp; When a pious
missionary of those early times, prior to adventuring into the
interior, inquired of a squatter if the Sabbath was kept in the
bush, &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; was the prompt reply; &lsquo;a clean
shirt and a shave.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;At the time of my
arrival,&rsquo; writes Mr. Westgarth, &lsquo;all Melbourne-bound
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>passengers
were put out by their respective ship&rsquo;s boats upon that
part of the northern beach of Port Philip that was nearest to
Melbourne, whence in struggling lines, as best they could, in hot
winds, they trod a bush-path of their own making, which, about a
mile and a half long, brought them to a punt or little boat just
above the Falls&mdash;which they crossed for the small charge of
threepence.&rsquo;&nbsp; There are people who still maintain that
Melbourne is planted on the wrong site, that Williamstown, with
its healthful level, might have been better, or Geelong; with its
beautiful ready-made harbour, and its direct access to all the
superior capabilities of the West and North-west.&nbsp; The
traveller, as he runs down to Sorrento by an excursion steamer,
may, perhaps, agree with the critics.&nbsp; But, then, Sorrento
would never have had a chance.&nbsp; Now it is a place to spend a
happy day in, and many are the Melbournites who lodge in the
vicinity.&nbsp; I would have tarried there longer, but
steamers&mdash;like time and tide&mdash;wait for no man.</p>
<p>In one thing Melbourne beats London and all Australia put
together, and that is in the number and excellence of its
coffee-palaces, which are a real boon to the travelling public,
and which may claim to have solved the question how, by
co-operation, to <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>provide homes of comfort and luxury for the great
middle-class of the community.&nbsp; The Federal Coffee-Palace in
Melbourne is a remarkable illustration of what may be done in
this way.&nbsp; Instead of spending three or four pounds a week
at an hotel, and being expected to injure my health for the
benefit of my landlord, I pay half a crown for my bed&mdash;it is
true it is high up on the sixth floor, but then I go up and down
by the lift, which is in active operation from seven in the
morning till midnight; I get a good breakfast in a handsome
apartment, served up by attractive young maidens in neat black
dresses, for which I pay one-and-threepence; I can have a good
lunch for a shilling; and my evening meal, with fish or flesh,
costs about the same sum.&nbsp; There is a caf&eacute; attached,
in which I can have a cup of coffee or some light refreshment at
any time; a reading-room, if I require it; a smoking-room, if I
am given to that mild form of self-indulgence; and a
billiard-room, if I require a little exercise after the worry of
the day.&nbsp; As soon as I rise I have a comfortable bath, which
is not an extra, as in England.&nbsp; Nor need I fear being
roasted alive, as half a dozen watchmen perambulate the place all
night.&nbsp; In England we have nothing of this kind.&nbsp; We
have large and grand hotels, but they are utterly beyond the
reach <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of
persons of moderate means; and it is a question whether, in these
days when it is hard to get a decent servant-girl, something
after the plan of the Federal Palace at Melbourne might not be
started in London and our other big cities, not as a rest for the
comfort and delectation of the weary traveller, but as an
associated home.&nbsp; It is only in that way that the increasing
difficulties connected with houses and servants, and the cost of
living in London, can be met and overcome.&nbsp; The servant-girl
in these coffee-palaces is far superior to her sister who acts
the part of maid-of-all-work in a London suburb.&nbsp; She is
always civil, always well dressed, always ready to oblige.&nbsp;
She knows when her work is over, and that is a great
consideration.&nbsp; She has her day out when she is off duty,
and that keeps her in good temper all the rest of the week.&nbsp;
At all times her appearance and behaviour are respectable.&nbsp;
I have always found her cheerful and pleasant, much given to
devoting her spare time to novel-reading, which helps to keep
alive romance in her heart and preserve her youth.&nbsp; It is
evident she is not over-worked in the coffee-palace; she looks
too well and flourishing.&nbsp; I hope she marries well, and
lives happily ever after.&nbsp; It seems to me that she deserves
a good husband and a good home.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>On the
Federal Coffee-Palace money has been spent with a liberal hand;
and it is run by a company, who find it, I believe, a commercial
success.&nbsp; All that is wanted is a little better
management.&nbsp; Melbourne is a city of fine buildings, and the
Federal may vie with any of them as regards external grandeur and
internal accommodation.&nbsp; The freehold alone cost
&pound;48,000, and the building and furniture for 400
sleeping-apartments, to say nothing of the public rooms, must
have cost at least &pound;150,000 more.&nbsp; Its tower, which is
200 feet high, is a landmark from all quarters.&nbsp; The site is
happily chosen, as the Federal is not only close to the terminus
of the railways, but is likewise in close proximity to the
wharves on the Yarra, which are now daily crowded with large and
powerful steam-vessels engaged in inter-colonial and foreign
trade.&nbsp; The Custom House is near at hand, and business-men
and visitors can, by means of the cable tramways in front of the
palace, be speedily conveyed to any of the city suburbs.&nbsp; It
has a post and telegraph-office attached, and the popular firm of
Thomas Cook and Son have an agency in connection with it.&nbsp;
Collins Street, in which it stands, is the centre of trade and
commerce.&nbsp; It is there all the great companies have their
headquarters, the papers are published, and all the wealth <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>and fashion
of the city congregates.&nbsp; The foundations of the new
building, which enclose an area of half an acre, were laid at an
expense of many thousands of pounds.&nbsp; The underground
arrangements are admirable.&nbsp; One apartment is devoted
entirely to pastry-cooks; in another is a freezing-apparatus, in
which meat, poultry, and game may be kept fresh for a month or
more.&nbsp; Another apartment is devoted to grills; and the
kitchens are connected with the floors above them by several
lifts, by which the cooked viands are noiselessly and rapidly
raised to the various sitting-rooms, and the dishes so returned
to the sculleries.&nbsp; As to the entrance, that must be seen to
be appreciated&mdash;wide folding-doors open into a grand marble
vestibule, which extends between massive columns into an interior
hall.&nbsp; In the centre is the principal staircase, leading to
the first-class dining-room and the upper stories.&nbsp; The area
above is surrounded by galleries which serve as balconies, where
the lady-visitors and their friends may be seen sitting all day
long gazing on the busy crowd of arrivals and departures
below.&nbsp; You may be almost said to sleep in marble halls, and
the beauty of it is that all this splendour is not for the
benefit of the bloated capitalist, but for the comfort of the
many.</p>
<p>One Sunday I had rather a strange experience.&nbsp; I <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>went to the
Presbyterian Church in Collins Street, where there was a large
congregation to listen to a fine sermon by the reverend minister
on the custom of the primitive Church to have all things in
common&mdash;a custom which the orator conclusively showed to the
satisfaction of his hearers, wealthy Scotchmen, with few leanings
towards Socialism in any form, was quite exceptional, and was not
to be dreamed of in these latter days.&nbsp; I had a pair of
gloves, which I laid down in the pew.&nbsp; When half-way out of
the church I recollected that I had left those gloves
behind.&nbsp; I returned to look for them, mentioning the fact to
the gentleman who sat next me.&nbsp; On rushing to where I sat I
found a pair of gloves exactly similar to my own at the back of
the pew, and, concluding that they were what I sought, returned
in triumph.&nbsp; Just as I had got to the door a young man came
and claimed the gloves&mdash;and I gave them up&mdash;when, to my
amazement, the same gentleman (?) who had sat in the pew with me,
and to whom I had mentioned the loss of my gloves, handed my own
over to me.&nbsp; It is true that the sermon was about having all
things in common, but I object to such a practical
application.</p>
<p>In Melbourne Dr. Strong, who was expelled from the Scotch
church to which I have already referred, <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>is making the
experiment of carrying on a church without a creed.&nbsp;
Apparently the attempt is a successful one.&nbsp; When I attended
the congregation was a large one, and the sermon very
interesting.&nbsp; It is a fine building in which they meet, and
the people seem to be highly respectable, as much so as I have
seen anywhere.&nbsp; Dr. Strong calls his place &lsquo;The
Australian Church.&rsquo;&nbsp; It seems to me, as far as I can
make out, that the wish is father to the thought.&nbsp; I see no
evidence in Australia that the people are discontented with the
old ways, or are ready for change.&nbsp; Men immersed in business
and money-making as a rule do not affect heresy; they are mostly
conservative in politics and religion.&nbsp; From what I hear, it
is the personal influence of Dr. Strong that has built the church
and filled it.&nbsp; He is very popular with his people.&nbsp;
They followed him from his old church to his new one, but they
are not fanatics in favour of their new denomination, and I
question whether out of Melbourne there is sufficient population
to be developed into anything worthy to take the somewhat
ambitious title of the Australian Church.&nbsp; The Wesleyans,
the Presbyterians, and the Church of England, have already gone
up and taken possession of the land, and they are organized,
which is half the battle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our people,&rsquo; said a
colonial bishop to me <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>one day, &lsquo;are not likely to be
caught by the Salvation Army.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Church has its own
organization, and it is that which keeps the flock from
wandering.&nbsp; As long as they get something in the way of
religious worship they are content.&nbsp; People who belong to
other bodies tell me that the Church of England parsons are poor
preachers, that they are, many of them, men who have failed in
other pulpits, or who have been unable to pass the requisite
examination, or whose characters do not stand high&mdash;and
certainly I have seen some queer specimens of the genus.&nbsp;
But then, says the devout worshipper, &lsquo;we go to church to
pray and to worship God.&nbsp; The sermon is not the main thing
with us, as it is amongst the other religious
bodies.&rsquo;&nbsp; It may be that he is wrong&mdash;I am not
about to contest that matter&mdash;but it seems to me that in
Melbourne the better preacher the man is the better does his
church fill; and that if the Church of England, or any other
religious body, seeks to be successful, due care must be taken
that there is life in the pulpit.&nbsp; The stranger would think
Melbourne a very religious city; much more so than London, or any
town or city at home.&nbsp; The public-houses are strictly
closed; the trains do not run till two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There
is no Sunday newspaper published (in Sydney there are two, and
both pay well).&nbsp; Except for the <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>well-dressed crowds on their way to
their favourite church (they are all churches here&mdash;Little
Bethels and Mount Zions are unknown), and the church bell, you
would think such places as Sydney and Melbourne on a Sunday
morning the cities of the dead.&nbsp; Walking along Bourke Street
one Sunday evening&mdash;a street always black with pedestrians
at that time&mdash;I saw a crowd hanging about the door of a
theatre.&nbsp; I went in and found a place full of real working
men in their working attire, who had come to enjoy a religious
discussion.&nbsp; I got in only at the end, and heard but the
orthodox reply from a gentleman who talked a good deal about
matter and space, and the operations of the one great God, who
had revealed Himself to man in the person of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
The crowd sat listening patiently till nine o&rsquo;clock, when
the gas was turned off, and they lit their pipes and went
home.&nbsp; I heard some speaking of the objector, whom I was too
late to hear, as a very clever fellow; but the mass seemed quite
indifferent.&nbsp; I spoke to one or two of the hearers, whose
minds seemed a perfect blank.&nbsp; There was no praying, no
singing, no attempt to attract, no pale youth with a concertina,
no tender maiden to sing a solo.&nbsp; In London the thing would
have been a failure.&nbsp; Here the working man has his beershop
and club, and his penny paper.&nbsp; <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>In Australia he has nothing of the
kind, and he is open to conviction even if it comes to him in a
secularist form.</p>
<p>There has lately passed away a man well known in Victoria as
Peter Lalor.&nbsp; He was an Irishman, and lived to be Speaker of
the Victorian Parliament; but it was as a revolutionist that he
gained his true fame.&nbsp; When the news of the discovery of
gold in Ballarat filled that district with seekers from every
part of the world, Mr. Peter Lalor was one of the first to put in
an appearance.&nbsp; Melbourne and Geelong were almost emptied of
their male inhabitants.&nbsp; Government was at its wit&rsquo;s
end how to preserve order among the young community.&nbsp; In
1855, the Government promulgated the right of the Crown to the
gold, and issued licenses to the diggers.&nbsp; With a view to
keep back the crowd, the license fee was increased from &pound;1
10s. to &pound;3 a month.&nbsp; This was more than the hardy
gold-diggers could stand.&nbsp; They were not represented in
Parliament, and they took the law into their own hands after
their patience had been exhausted by the insults of the martinets
in office, who were sent to see that they had all the requisite
licenses, and to whom hunting the diggers was a pleasant
sport.&nbsp; The Gold Commissioners, as they were called, were
frequently corrupt, and always <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>insolent and overbearing.&nbsp; At
length matters came to a crisis.&nbsp; A digger got killed in a
house that did not bear a good character, and the landlord was
considered to have been a participator in the murder.&nbsp; The
man was tried with others, and discharged.&nbsp; In their
indignation over the untimely end of a chum, the diggers
subscribed, and had a new trial.&nbsp; It was while holding a
meeting for this purpose that they came into collision with the
police, who were guarding the hotel.&nbsp; The place was burnt
down, and three of the incendiaries were imprisoned.&nbsp;
Another meeting was then held to demand the release of the
prisoners, and at the same time to claim manhood suffrage, and
other political and social reforms.&nbsp; Soon, losing all
confidence in the Government, they began to drill and arm.&nbsp;
Fighting commenced in real earnest under the flag of the Southern
Cross.&nbsp; They were attacked, and amongst the wounded was
their general, the late Speaker, Peter Lalor.&nbsp; The eyes of
the blind were opened.&nbsp; Government, in time, learned to act
rationally, and the result was, Ballarat became the centre of a
law-abiding people&mdash;a people, nevertheless, given over to
the worship of the golden calf.&nbsp; &lsquo;I remember
it,&rsquo; said a man to me yesterday, as I wandered along its
streets, down which a whirlwind of white dust was unpleasantly
blowing, &lsquo;when there was only one <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>house in the
town; when it was all gum-trees and tents.&nbsp; There,&rsquo;
said he, pointing to a particular spot at the entrance of the
town&mdash;&lsquo;is where the Welcome Nugget was found; it was
worth &pound;5,000, and was discovered by a couple of diggers who
had barely been earning their living for months.&nbsp;
There,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;I had a miner&rsquo;s right; I
sold it for &pound;50 to the present owner, of whom a syndicate
has been trying to buy it for &pound;40,000.&nbsp; Them was hard
times.&nbsp; I remember when I walked twelve miles to a store,
and could only bring back a pound of butter, and that was a
favour.&rsquo;&nbsp; But most of the miners lost their money as
quickly as they made it.&nbsp; &lsquo;In 1860,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;I was ready to go home, but in 1861 I was up a
tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ballarat has now settled down into a rather humdrum sort of
city, with a population of about 50,000.&nbsp; The diggers are
mostly dead or gone, and few traces of them remain, save in the
turned-up earth outside the town, where there are traces still
remaining of what they called shallow digging.&nbsp; On a hill
just outside, also, it is evident that there has been a good deal
of soil turned up, or turned out, in the search for gold, but no
alluvial deposits exist; gold, if found, is only found in quartz,
and that has to be crushed, and the gold eliminated by machinery
of a very complicated <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>and costly character, to secure which
a company has to be formed, and then the returns, in the shape of
dividends, are generally small.&nbsp; It is unhealthy work, too,
in the mines, and I was not surprised to find that many of the
men had left, and taken to farming instead.&nbsp; Any morning in
the week you will find a lot of agents and brokers in the
Ballarat Mining Exchange, ready to do a little business in the
way of speculation, and that is, perhaps, all that remains to
testify as to what Ballarat was in its golden age.&nbsp; As to
the riotous living of the past, that is a matter of
tradition.&nbsp; The fact is, Ballarat has had its day.&nbsp;
Where the carcase is, there the eagles gather, and little of the
carcase is left in Ballarat.&nbsp; Mount Morgan and Broken Hill
are now names of greater power.&nbsp; Ballarat has an
Episcopalian bishop.&nbsp; The Wesleyans and Presbyterians are
very strong in the town.&nbsp; The Roman Catholics and the
Congregationalists are also in evidence.&nbsp; Somehow or other I
missed the Episcopalian place of worship; but with its schools
and other buildings, with its wood warehouses and stores, I felt
how great had been the change, how sober and quiet had become the
Ballarat of to-day.&nbsp; &lsquo;We shall meet again, sir,&rsquo;
said my unknown friend, in a tone the honesty of which deeply
affected me&mdash;&lsquo;we shall meet again, sir, some
day.&nbsp; Let us hope it will be in the right place.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Of the
romance of Ballarat one gets a good idea from a story which I
found in a newspaper which will certainly interest the general
reader.&nbsp; The history of one of the Ballarat claims, called
the Blacksmith&rsquo;s Claim because its first owner belonged to
this craft, reads like a page of romance.&nbsp; The blacksmith,
with a party of eight, all novices, sank the shaft in so
irregular and unworkmanlike a manner, that it was absolutely at
the risk of his life that a man made the descent to the
bottom.&nbsp; Without opening out a regular drive they washed all
the stuff within reach, and after realising &pound;12,800 offered
it for sale, but so wet and rotten was the ground, so badly sunk
the shaft, that at first no purchaser could be found.&nbsp; At
last a party of ten plucked up courage and bought all right and
title to the claim and tools for &pound;77.&nbsp; They entered
into possession at noon on Saturday, and long before the sun had
set had in their possession &pound;2,000 worth of gold.&nbsp; By
working day and night in spells till the following Monday they
raised this to &pound;10,000.&nbsp; Then, after the usual
reckless manner of lucky diggers, they left this mine of wealth,
and went on the spree for a week.&nbsp; Their tenants made good
use of the time at their disposal; they opened up two drives; and
before the week was out were the happy possessors of
&pound;14,400, all taken out of the <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>claim.&nbsp; The other party then
returned, and after a week&rsquo;s work, during which they
realized &pound;9,000, they sold out to a storekeeper for
&pound;100, who put in a gang to work on shares, and these,
labouring in a desultory fashion for a fortnight, took but
&pound;5,000.&nbsp; At the end of that time, one of the party, an
old hand from Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land, undermined the props, and
next morning on returning to work the men found the whole of the
workings had fallen in.&nbsp; The rest of the party appeared to
have taken this misfortune very calmly, and to have completely
abandoned the claim, for no mention is made of their further
proceedings; but it is related how the author of the mischief
coolly marked out a claim 24 feet square on the top of the ruin,
and working with a hired party, sunk a shaft straight as a die
for the gutter.&nbsp; The first tubful of wash dirt they found
turned out 40 lb. weight of gold, and the next two averaged 10
lb. each, and as Ballarat gold was and is superior to any other
at all times, fetching at least &pound;4 an ounce, those three
bucketfuls of earth were worth &pound;2,880 to their fortunate
possessor.&nbsp; Altogether, out of that small area, hardly
larger than a good-sized room, was taken in a few weeks gold
worth nearly &pound;30,000.</p>
<p>Round Ballarat the country is rather prettier than is the
average of Australian scenery.&nbsp; All the way <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>from Geelong,
situated rather charmingly at the bend of a pretty bay, which is
bound to become a fashionable watering-place, the land rises till
you nearly reach Ballarat, when you go down a slight
incline.&nbsp; The soil is good, and there are many twenty-acre
farms, and the heat is not so great as in Melbourne.&nbsp; Out of
the town there is a fine sheet of water, devoted to boating and
black swans, and there is a botanical garden, in which I own I
was somewhat disappointed, though everyone (perhaps it was for
that very reason) said it was one of the places which I was bound
to go and see, and which would delight me greatly.&nbsp; The
Ballarat people, I was told in the train, were hospitable.&nbsp;
It may be so, but I can bear no testimony on that point, as none
of their hospitality was extended to me.&nbsp; My only experience
of them was at an ordinary at the principal hotel, and there I
was not particularly gratified, as conversation seemed quite out
of the question.&nbsp; Now I come to think of it, that must have
been through fear of the head waiter, who certainly was a very
superior personage indeed, and was much better got up than any of
his guests.&nbsp; Be this as it may, it was with little regret
that I got on board the train and left the Golden City, with its
green foliage, its red-brick houses, its white town-hall, its
awful dust, its broad streets, and its rough pedestrians, far
behind.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Anthony
Trollope tells us that no one who has ever paid Sydney a visit
will leave it without a tear or a regret.&nbsp; I confess I had
no such feeling as I got into a hansom and drove down to the
<i>Liguria</i>&mdash;a ship dear to many&mdash;which is to be
known no more to Australian friends, as her destination
henceforth is to be South America; but she took me safely to
Melbourne, where I landed, to be more than ever charmed with the
busy city and its people, a city and a people who believe
themselves destined to the leadership of these sunny lands.&nbsp;
Sydney is too old, they say, handsome as it is in parts, and
Brisbane is too hot, to be in the running.&nbsp; As long as
Sydney is faithful to Free Trade she will be a great emporium of
commerce; but the democracy rule in Sydney, and the democracy all
the world over have lost faith in Free Trade.&nbsp; Sydney has
little to boast of besides its unrivalled harbour, lined with
health resorts where wealth, and beauty, and fashion congregate,
and where all the residences are of the most captivating
character&mdash;white villas with verandas, rising out of green
lawns shaded by tropical plants, and gorgeous with tropical
flowers, in bloom, at any rate, the greater part of the
year&mdash;where the blue waves ever murmur underneath.&nbsp; I
must own, too, that some of the shops in Sydney <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>are far finer
than any to be seen in Melbourne; and the post-office at Sydney
is, perhaps, the noblest building of the kind to be seen
anywhere.&nbsp; A similar remark applies to the Town Hall,
completed after I left.&nbsp; But Melbourne has, in Collins
Street, a unique and stately thoroughfare, such as can be seen
nowhere else&mdash;a street as gay of an afternoon as Regent
Street, and as difficult in crossing, owing to its swarming
traffic, almost as Cheapside.&nbsp; Sydney has no such show; and
the Melbourne ladies tell me that it is to that place that the
Sydney drapers come for the latest fashions.&nbsp; It seems to me
that there is a great deal more drinking in Sydney than in
Melbourne.&nbsp; Almost every other house you come to is an
hotel, and it has its bar, where, under the presidency of two or
three rather showy damsels, the drinking goes on all day.&nbsp;
In both cities there is apparently more drinking than in London,
except in the poorest quarters, affected by the beggar, and the
pauper, and the tramp, by depraved men, and women infinitely
worse.&nbsp; But for Melbourne and Sydney a defence may be made
which is not available at home.&nbsp; The population in both
cities is of a very migratory character; a large number of men
spend their time in passing from one colony to another, and in
this way they make many acquaintances, <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>and when
they meet they have a drink.&nbsp; In Sydney the fashion is to
hand you the bottle and let you help yourself.&nbsp; The landlord
finds it to his interest to do so.&nbsp; The customer takes less
than the landlord would give him for his sixpence.&nbsp; The
customer knows that he has the day before him, and that it will
not do to get exhilarated too soon.&nbsp; There are drinks
awaiting him with other friends at other bars and at other hours,
and so he takes as little whisky as he can in his glass.&nbsp;
Superficially, Melbourne seems the more moral town, but so far as
my experience goes all cities are much alike.&nbsp; Chicago
proudly boasts that it is the wickedest city in the world, but I
much doubt its claim to that bad pre-eminence.&nbsp; I only met
one shady character there, and he was an Englishman.&nbsp; That
there are rogues in Melbourne I readily admit.&nbsp; As I was
passing up Bourke Street looking for a place to rest in till my
friend&rsquo;s carriage, with his lady, was to call for me to
take me to his handsome suburban residence, a well-dressed man
accosted me with an inquiry as to how I had been enjoying myself
since I landed from the <i>Liguria</i>.&nbsp; Having replied, I
said I was going to have a cup of coffee and a cigar in a
handsome <i>caf&eacute;</i> just opposite where we were
standing.&nbsp; After I had been seated a few minutes he made his
appearance to tell <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>me that he was staying at the Melbourne Club,
membership of which is the sign and seal of the most extreme
respectability; that he was going to England in the
<i>Austral</i> (I had told him I was going in that ship to
Adelaide) in consequence of the delicacy of his wife&rsquo;s
health, and that he wished me to come along with him to introduce
me to a few friends.&nbsp; I went with him, and in a few minutes
was seated in the bar-room of an adjoining hotel, refusing every
offer to have a drink.&nbsp; A man came up to my friend with a
bill, requesting payment, as he was hard up.&nbsp; Accordingly my
gentleman put his hand in his pocket, pulling out three or four
sovereigns.&nbsp; Alas! he was a sovereign short.&nbsp; Could I
lend him one?&nbsp; Unfortunately I could not.&nbsp; &lsquo;Could
I lend him half-a-sovereign?&rsquo; I again deplored my inability
to do anything of the kind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It does not matter,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; Turning to
the man he continued, &lsquo;Come over the way and I will get the
money,&rsquo; and away he went, telling me he would be back in
five minutes.&nbsp; I waited ten, but it is needless to say I saw
him no more.&nbsp; Leaving the pub, I met a policeman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you any rogues about here?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should say we had,&rsquo; replied the policeman, with
a grin; &lsquo;why, last month we had one out here <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>from New
York.&nbsp; He said he thought he knew the ropes pretty well, but
he felt like a child out here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If this policeman&rsquo;s tale be true, Melbourne must indeed
be marvellous in more senses than one.&nbsp; To my mind the most
marvellous part of Melbourne is to be found in its suburbs.&nbsp;
Melbourne is fortunate in this respect.&nbsp; All along the
seashore the coast is lined with handsome residences, quite equal
in every respect to those of our London merchant princes.&nbsp;
At one of them, where I spent a couple of happy days, I found
residing in wealth and comfort a son of the well-known and
still-lamented, in Nonconformist and Liberal circles, Mr.
Grimwade, of Ipswich.&nbsp; He calls his place Harleston, the
name of the little sleepy East Anglian town in which he was
born.&nbsp; The colonists love the old English names.&nbsp; In
the aristocratic quarter known as Toorak I spent a pleasant day
with Mr. Murray Smith, the one man whom all the Victorians regard
as the most refined of gentlemen, and most able of
politicians.&nbsp; In London, as some of my readers may remember,
Mr. Murray Smith, as Agent General, was quite as much a social
success as he is at home.&nbsp; He calls his place Repton, in
memory of his old Derbyshire Grammar School.&nbsp; I discovered
the Rev. J. J. Halley, the energetic secretary of the Australian
Congregational <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Union, living in a pretty villa at Camberwell, which he
ventures to call Irwell, a stream to most Englishmen who have
ever been at Manchester, somewhat dark and malodorous.&nbsp; It
is thus the colonists keep up the tender memories of their
far-off native land.&nbsp; As in New South Wales, so in Victoria,
a good deal of attention is turned to politics.&nbsp; In the
latter colony the Parliament lasts three years, and a general
election was at hand; but the worst of it is, that while the
people are in many quarters determined to have a fight, in
reality there is nothing to fight about.&nbsp; I attended what
was advertised as a monster meeting of the Liberal party, but the
attendance did not consist of more than 400, and the speaking
was, at any rate, not up to the English level, though one speaker
did somehow manage to close with an irrelevant peroration, in
which he invoked the spirit which in England had carried Catholic
emancipation, had removed the Test and Corporation Acts, and was
prepared to do justice to Ireland&mdash;and this was in
connection with a meeting called to support the Liberal platform,
the main article of which is protection to native industry and a
stock tax for the farmer, who complains bitterly of the way in
which New South Wales and Queensland beef is poured into the home
market.&nbsp; It <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>seems strange to read of a candidate appealing to the
electors for support as &lsquo;A Liberal and
Protectionist.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the fact is, in Victoria everyone
is a Protectionist, and on the vital issues of the past the
community is now at one.&nbsp; A coalition Government is in
office, and it is hard to see how any other can exist.&nbsp; A
nationalist party is now in course of formation, which has for
its object Australian unity, to be accomplished by free
inter-colonial interchange.&nbsp; In the meanwhile the Liberals
seem to have only, to fight about the constitution of the present
Government&mdash;their chief complaint being that the Liberal
element in it is not sufficiently strong.</p>
<p>Zeno tells us that a man has two ears and one mouth, that he
may say little and hear much.&nbsp; Australian M.P.&rsquo;s are
quite of a different way of thinking.&nbsp; Of the late Victorian
Parliament, a critic in <i>The Melbourne Argus</i> writes that
during its existence &lsquo;the worst elements in the Assembly
have had sway instead of the better.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of all methods
of blocking business, none is so plausible as that of moving the
adjournment of the House.&nbsp; In nine cases out of ten, a
review says, such motions result in a mere waste of time.&nbsp;
Another nuisance is the habit of speaking often and long, as
every member is entitled to speak once on every question before
the House, and as often as he likes <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>when in Committee.&nbsp; This kind
of obstruction is raised into an art, and is called
&lsquo;stonewalling.&rsquo;&nbsp; As to indecent language, I find
one M.P. calling a judge of a neighbouring colony &lsquo;a
ruffian and a scoundrel, and a bloody-minded man,&rsquo;
referring to the Chief Secretary as being &lsquo;as ignorant as a
pig on the subject,&rsquo; and, in short, acting as much like an
Irish patriotic M.P. at home as was possible.&nbsp; Again, I
found a gentleman who was afflicted with heart disease, and whom
nothing but a sense of duty kept at his post, is referred to by
an honourable M.P. as follows: &lsquo;But nobody takes any notice
of a dying man.&nbsp; He is going to be wafted
aloft.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, a Mr. Jones, referring to a Mr. Reid,
said: &lsquo;The Hon. Member for Fitzroy with his cavernous mouth
could laugh louder than the rest of the Assembly.&nbsp; That
cavernous mouth of his was the only thing the hon. member had to
connect him with other people.&nbsp; He had a mouth to laugh at a
joke, but no brains to originate one.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, another
M.P. spoke of Sir Graham Berry as &lsquo;that miserable old
counterfeit, that white-haired political rogue, that bandy-legged
old schemer.&rsquo;&nbsp; After this it is not surprising to read
how the same orator, in the course of a scene which occurred on
his being called to order, spoke of a fellow M.P. as one who had
tried to diddle a barmaid out of threepence!&nbsp; It really
seems as if Parliamentary <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>institutions had become
effete.&nbsp; In New South Wales the Dibbs Ministry has already
been hurled from office.&nbsp; I have seen alike its rise and
fall, and it is evident that at Sydney, as in Melbourne, the
obstructionists will be strong enough, not to do any good
themselves, but to interfere with anyone wishing to achieve any
good for the colony whatever.</p>
<p>The Trades Political Platform made its appearance at Melbourne
when I was there.&nbsp; It consists of fifteen planks, the chief
of which are the maintenance and extension of protection to local
industries, the extension of the same principle to the farming
and grazing industry by an adequate increase in the duty on
imported cereals and stock, the representation of labour on
public boards and the commission of the peace, an Eight Hours
Legislation Bill (in Victoria the shops are closed at an early
hour by Act of Parliament), the abolition of plural voting, the
introduction of a Bill to prevent criminal and pauper labour in
the community&mdash;rather hard this, in a colony where the
pauper desires to work, and, able-bodied as many of her paupers
are, is really qualified for labour&mdash;the extension of the
franchise to seamen.&nbsp; Women voters are favoured by the
Liberals, though there is a good deal to be said on the other
side of the question.&nbsp; As it is, the women do
interfere.&nbsp; For instance, amongst the Melbourne <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>candidates
is a gentleman who has unfortunately acquired an undesirable
reputation.&nbsp; The ladies have met, and resolved that he is
not a fit and proper person to represent a respectable
constituency.&nbsp; The gentleman in question sneers at the
meeting as a hole-and-corner one, but I find several ministers of
religion took part in it.&nbsp; Indeed, I think all denominations
were represented with the exception of the clergy of the Church
of England, who are as little inclined to co-operate with other
bodies out here as they are at home.&nbsp; As a further
indication of the political opinion forming in the Australian
colonies, I note that many of the candidates for Parliamentary
election are in favour of a tax on absentees, which, however, is
but a small matter after all, as there is a growing tendency on
the part of wealthy colonists to remain out here rather than
settle in the old country.&nbsp; I question whether in the
colonies there is much chance of the &lsquo;One man one
vote&rsquo; being carried.&nbsp; It finds no favour in the Second
Chamber, to which here, as at home, many sober people look as the
bulwark of constitutional freedom.&nbsp; The worst thing I know
about Melbourne is its gambling.&nbsp; <i>The Melbourne Daily
Telegraph</i>, writing of the last grand race&mdash;the race
which the ladies make the occasion of the display of all that is
novel or charming in toilettes, estimates <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>the bets
made with the bookmakers between Derby Day and Steeplechase Day
as amounting to &pound;700,000, and calculates that &lsquo;the
stakes, the cost and keep of the horses, the revenues of the
<i>five hundred racing clubs</i> of the colony, the expenditure
of its army of bookmakers, and other forms of expenditure,&rsquo;
will bring the racing budget for the year up to &pound;800,000
sterling.&nbsp; We in England are bad enough in this respect I
admit, but there is no reason whatever why Australia should
follow a bad example.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you feel disposed to have a look
at Sydney, respected reader, do not go there when an election is
on.&nbsp; Last night, till eleven, the street in which I have
found a temporary residence was filled with an excited crowd,
hooting and cheering, as from time to time great placards were
posted up as to the result of the day&rsquo;s elections.&nbsp;
Wherever I have been, the talk has been of Free Trade or
Protection.&nbsp; The farmers want Protection; the towns are
averse to it.&nbsp; High railway charges deprive the farmer of
his Sydney market, and he is undersold by the foreigner.&nbsp;
The Free Traders are obliged to hedge to satisfy the
workman.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t stand the Chinese, and more <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>than one
Free Trade candidate has had to promise to vote for prohibitory
duties on articles of Chinese manufacture.&nbsp; Another one
declared that he was against Protection, but would be quite ready
to tax foreign goods for fiscal purposes&mdash;that is, for
protection for the New South Wales manufacturer.&nbsp; The Free
Traders have won, but they will go to Parliament with diminished
force.&nbsp; There is a good deal of nonsense talked here as well
as in England.&nbsp; One M.P. complained recently &lsquo;about
the absence of his name <i>appearing</i> in the Sydney morning
papers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said another, as he banged the balcony bar
with his fist, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, gentlemen, that
there was some grave <i>misapprehension</i> of the public money
during the time that the Parkes party was in power.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Another had the hardihood to venture on the use of a French term,
as he dilated on what he called &lsquo;the scandalis doin&rsquo;s
of the Parkes <i>rejamey</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; But a certain
candidate who shall be nameless heads the list (or, as they say
out here, the &lsquo;bunch&rsquo;) of blundering orators when he
remarked that &lsquo;If the days of miracles were as common as in
the days of Ananias, they might expect to see three of the finest
pillars of salt that ever were on view.&rsquo;&nbsp; One lesson
we may learn&mdash;that is, the advantage of having the elections
all over on the same day, and that is how it is done in
Victoria.&nbsp; Here the <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>struggle continues for three weeks,
and a good deal of bad feeling is engendered in consequence.</p>
<p>In spite of the dust and the heat&mdash;to change my
theme&mdash;there is much to admire in Sydney, and I have had a
fine look at the town from the lofty tower of the new Post
Office, a tower some 260 feet above the level of George Street,
where it stands.&nbsp; Afar off are the Heads, into which the
great steamers come and go.&nbsp; At your feet lies the city,
with its fine public buildings, all of yellow sandstone; its
narrow streets, its busy crowds.&nbsp; Far as the eye can reach
in every direction spread pretty suburbs, and there the foliage
begins to mingle with the gray roofs and white chimneys of the
suburban houses, and you realize the fact how great is the
population outside the city itself.&nbsp; The harbour is a thing
of beauty and a joy for ever; how Cook could have missed it seems
a mystery.&nbsp; Over that harbour the fine river
steamers&mdash;of American fashion, far superior to anything we
have on the Thames&mdash;ferry backwards and forwards all day
long.&nbsp; On a Saturday it is alive with yachts&mdash;little
cockle-shells, with two great sails, that soon upset.&nbsp; I saw
one capsize in a sudden squall as I was crossing to Manly
Beach&mdash;the Brighton of Sydney, as they call it here, but it
is no more like our Brighton than a rustic maiden resembles a
society beauty.&nbsp; All along the <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>harbour are fairy villas, green
foliage, miniature bays, rivers, and all that can give life and
warmth to the landscape in the shape of holiday-makers.&nbsp;
That harbour, with its Botanical Gardens on one side, alone would
compensate for a good deal, and reconcile one even to the crowds
of Sydney who fill up the streets at night and prevent all
enjoyment.&nbsp; Sunday is quite a relief.&nbsp; It is a day of
rest indeed, far more so than in England.&nbsp; In the morning,
instead of going to the noble cathedral, I turned into the
Congregational Church in Pitt Street, but the minister was away,
and so I fancy were his people, as the place was but half full;
but I am told on a Sunday night there is a very fine
congregation.&nbsp; Four or five hundred young men were met in
the fine building known as the Y.M.C.A., where they listened with
much interest to the address delivered by the Secretary, Mr.
Walker, and at a temperance hall near there was a service fairly
attended; while close by, the New Church were meeting for public
worship.&nbsp; In the evening there was a good deal of open-air
preaching.&nbsp; In one quarter I heard so much from a young man
about the &lsquo;&rsquo;oly hangels&rsquo; that I was compelled
to retreat.&nbsp; Christian effort is not out of place anywhere
in Australia, and apparently in Sydney least of all.&nbsp; The
churches have quite as much to contend against there as at
home.&nbsp; <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Crime and pauperism and vice, strange as it may seem,
are quite as plentiful in this land of gold and milk and honey as
at home.&nbsp; Alas! you may change the climate, but the man
remains the same.</p>
<p>One of the blots of Sydney is the street tramcar, drawn by a
snorting engine, which makes night and day hideous.&nbsp; As a
nuisance and a means of getting rid of the surplus population it
seems an admirable contrivance.&nbsp; The cabs are not bad, and
the drivers quite as civil as those at home, which, however, is
not saying much; but the omnibuses are very old and shaky, and at
times the noise they make is so great that conversation is quite
out of the question.&nbsp; The Chinese are everywhere, and when
they are driven away it is hard to see how the townspeople will
get their fruit or their vegetables&mdash;as the Anglo-Saxons,
whether native or Australian, seem to hold gardening in contempt,
whereas the heathen Chinee will get hold of a bit of waste land
which no one would ever think of tilling, and straightway it
rejoices and blossoms as the rose.&nbsp; Many of them are
tradesmen, and have shops in the best streets in the place.&nbsp;
For cabinet-making of all kinds they have quite a talent, but
they have few friends, although, as a tradesman in Sydney
remarked to me, &lsquo;They are a good deal better than the
people who find fault with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>Sydney, like Melbourne and Adelaide, rejoices in a
university based on the model of University College, London, and
established by the State in 1850.&nbsp; Its buildings are
magnificent, and a portion of them are set apart for the School
of Medicine attached.&nbsp; The prospects of the university are
excellent, and it cannot fail to exert a most beneficial
influence on the future of Australia.&nbsp; The Australian
Museum, which is the oldest institution of the kind in Australia,
occupies a conspicuous site in Sydney, facing one of the
principal parks; it is open on Sundays.&nbsp; One of the most
popular institutions of the town is the Free Public Library,
which, in 1877, had a lending branch attached to it to meet the
wants of country residents.&nbsp; The National Art Gallery,
established in 1880, is also open on Sundays.&nbsp; It contains
an excellent collection of paintings and statuary, comprising
some of the most famous works of the best modern artists of the
old world, and includes several very valuable gifts from private
persons.&nbsp; The extent of streets and lanes within the
boundaries of the city is 105 miles, and they are mostly in good
order, many of them being laid with wood blocks.&nbsp; Its new
Town Hall, opened since I left, is the finest on the
continent.&nbsp; The great difficulty in Sydney, and all over New
South Wales, <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>seems to be house accommodation.&nbsp; The poor have a
hard time of it as regards sleeping apartments, and one does not
envy the occupiers of the little corrugated iron-roofed shanties
in which, as a rule, the workman hides his diminished head.&nbsp;
In all our great towns the artisans have better homes than they
have in Sydney and the other Australian towns.&nbsp; Then there
is the drought to make everything in the shape of agricultural
produce or garden stuff dear, with the exception of meat, which
is about half the price that it is at home.&nbsp; Eggs are
scarce, milk is fourpence a quart, and, as far as I can learn,
other provisions are very little cheaper than in London.&nbsp; In
sanitary arrangements the colonies are far behind the old
country.&nbsp; In his retiring address, the President of the
Victorian Branch of the Medical Association, Dr. Rowan, denounces
the &lsquo;infamous&rsquo; acts committed by land syndicates,
who, in laying out their townships, acted as if they considered
drainage a prejudice, sunlight a delusion, and ventilation a
weakness to be treated with derision.&nbsp; If ever, said he, a
city rendered itself liable to be plague-stricken, it was
Melbourne.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether a similar remark
applies to Sydney, but I do know that there the rate of infant
mortality is alarmingly high.&nbsp; In Australia, as in the old
country, they have not yet learned what to <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>do with
their sewage.&nbsp; In Sydney they laid out a million of money,
and then discovered that they had simply poured all their filth
into the harbour; but Sydney has now seen the error of its ways,
and at enormous expense constructed a tunnel many miles long to
take the sewage right away to the sea.&nbsp; At Melbourne the
smell from the Yarra river is overpowering.&nbsp; In Adelaide
they have solved the difficulty, and have a sewage farm that pays
well; but Adelaide is a small place when compared with Sydney or
Melbourne.&nbsp; A good deal remains to be done if the health of
the great colonial towns is to be preserved.&nbsp; Equally
important is the water question.&nbsp; What is wanted are tanks
that shall conserve the rainwater when it falls.&nbsp; I have
ridden miles and miles and seen great rivers nothing but beds of
sand, and creeks, where the winter torrents flow, nothing but
great fissures in the parched plains, in which the cattle hide
themselves from the blazing sun.&nbsp; New South Wales can never
prosper till it has a proper water supply.&nbsp; To provide this
should be the first duty of the Government.&nbsp; I suppose it is
because people make their money quickly that the Government grant
so many holidays.&nbsp; It is a great nuisance this to merchants
and traders.&nbsp; You rush off to the bank, and find it shut up,
and on the door a notice to the effect <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>that it is
Bank-holiday.&nbsp; The mass of the people work on all the
same.&nbsp; A Bank-holiday in no way concerns them, and
consequently a Bank-holiday here has little likeness to the
similar function at home&mdash;when all our big cities empty
their living crowds to be a wonder and a terror to all the
country round.&nbsp; The public offices are always being closed
on some pretence or another.&nbsp; Sometimes it is an
agricultural show, sometimes it is a race; any excuse does.&nbsp;
And the bankers&rsquo; clerks, as regards hours, are much better
off than their brethren at home; in all parts of Australia the
banks are closed at three.</p>
<p>It is a fair land, this new Australian continent, and well
worthy to be inhabited by the energetic Anglo-Saxon race.&nbsp;
The whole mountain system of New South Wales lies below the limit
of perpetual snow.&nbsp; The grandeur of the scenery is not to be
compared with that of the Alps or the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; On
the contrary, from the plains, the mountains look rather
insignificant; but once on them, and looking into the gorges
below, clothed with verdure, or on the broad plains far beyond,
you are struck with the magnificent scale on which Nature has
worked in these solitudes.&nbsp; Over all is a mantle of blue
haze, which makes the whole effect most striking, and has given
to the range of hills visible from Sydney the <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>appropriate
name of the Blue Mountains.&nbsp; However, there is nothing
equalling the view you get as you enter Sydney through Port
Jackson.&nbsp; It is needless to say a word of Sydney
harbour.&nbsp; It holds the first place amongst the harbours of
the world for convenience of entrance, depth of water, and
natural shipping facilities.&nbsp; The area of water surface of
the harbour proper is 15 square miles, and the shore line is
reckoned to extend 165 miles.&nbsp; Along it are the homes of
many of the well-to-do of Sydney, which is the metropolis of New
South Wales, and the mother city of the Australians.&nbsp; The
city and its suburbs occupy 100 square miles, and accommodate
about 350,000 people.&nbsp; I am agreeably disappointed with
Sydney.&nbsp; Its shops and public buildings and hotels are
handsomer, and its streets broader, than I had anticipated.&nbsp;
I was frightened, I own, by what Mr. Froude has written about its
mosquitoes.&nbsp; Perhaps mosquitoes do not like me; I am not
sorry.&nbsp; Coming to Sydney by sea you feel, on the whole, that
Eden cannot be far off.</p>
<p>Nor is the climate so bad as some people fancy.&nbsp; In
Naples, where so many English go, the summer is warmer and the
winter much colder than at Sydney.&nbsp; The famed resorts on the
Mediterranean seaboard, it is now confessed, bear no comparison
with the <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>Pacific slope of New South Wales, either for natural
salubrity or the comparative mildness of the summer and winter;
while the epidemics and pestilences which have devastated the
regions of ancient civilization have never made their appearance
on Australian shores.&nbsp; The Hawkesbury formation over which
the city of Sydney is built provides it with an inexhaustive
supply of sandstone of the highest quality for building
purposes.&nbsp; The beauty of Sydney street architecture owes
much to it, as it is a material admirably adapted for
architectural effect, being of a pleasant colour, fine grain, and
easily worked.</p>
<p>Sydney is not only the metropolis, but the chief shipping port
of the colony, its trade being larger than that of any city in
the southern hemisphere.&nbsp; All the necessary tools and
appliances for the repairing of ships are found in
dockyards.&nbsp; The new graving dock, now being completed by the
Government, will be the largest single dock in the world, and
capable of receiving vessels drawing 32 feet of water.&nbsp; For
natural facilities for shipping Sydney stands unrivalled.&nbsp;
The water deepens abruptly from the shores, so that the largest
vessels may be berthed alongside the wharves and quays.&nbsp; The
Sydneyites love their harbour, and well may they do so, for none
fairer is to be found under the sun.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>think of
our harbour?&rsquo; is the first question asked a stranger.&nbsp;
A tale is told of the captain of an English man-of-war which was
at anchor here, that he was so tired of the question being
constantly put that he had a blackboard hung over the side of his
ship, on which he had chalked up, with a view to save trouble and
prevent further inquiries: &lsquo;We admire your harbour very
much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is a curious fact how little the cry of the &lsquo;three
acres and a cow&rsquo; seems to affect the people.&nbsp; They
will flock to large towns.&nbsp; In England they all go to
London.&nbsp; It is the same in America.&nbsp; Land is to be had
in abundance, but, nevertheless, the town offers greater
inducements than the country.&nbsp; In New South Wales, as in
Victoria, this is everywhere the case.&nbsp; The increase of the
population of Sydney during the seventeen years which closed with
1887 has been 67 per cent., and that of the suburbs 280 per
cent., while that of the country districts amounted to 90 per
cent.&nbsp; As usual in a dense city crowd, there are a good many
black sheep.&nbsp; A leading police official stated recently that
he believed fully 70 per cent. of the inhabitants of the city
were directly or indirectly affected by the gambling clubs that
obtained amongst them.&nbsp; Public-houses, tobacconists&rsquo;
shops, and clubs were in a vast number of cases but gambling <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>houses in
disguise.&nbsp; In Sydney there is consequently a good deal of
poverty, and last winter relief works were established for the
benefit of some three thousand unemployed; yet the skilled
artisan gets good wages, and as I write the plasterers are out on
strike for an advance of 1s. per day as wages, the present rate
being 10s.&mdash;not bad when one remembers Sydney enjoys
free-trade prices, and that there is no protracted winter to
interfere with building operations.&nbsp; These unemployed had as
rations ten pounds of flour, ten pounds of meat, two pounds of
sugar and a quarter of a pound of tea, with a minimum wage of 3s.
per day, and that day, it must be remembered, is but eight
hours&rsquo; work.&nbsp; The result of this kindness was that
Sydney, as long as the work lasted, was filled with idle loafers
and vagabonds from all the country round.&nbsp; Charity seems to
do a deal of mischief abroad as well as at home.</p>
<p>Of the original inhabitants of the country you see few traces,
either in New South Wales or in Victoria.&nbsp; It is in
Queensland and South Australia that they most abound.&nbsp; They
have been badly treated by the whites, and in many cases they
took a horrible revenge.&nbsp; They now give little trouble, and
work peacefully for their former enemies.&nbsp; Amongst their
good qualities are a love of religious mystery, a <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>stoical
contempt for pain, and a deep reverence for their departed
friends and ancestors.&nbsp; The only unpleasant characteristic
of the present inhabitants of New South Wales is the broad line
of demarcation between Churchmen and Dissenters.&nbsp; Often the
Church of England man in the colonies looks upon all Dissenters
with aversion.&nbsp; The other day I heard of a little girl who
was forbidden to play with the intelligent and pretty daughter of
a wealthy colonist on the plea that she was a Dissenter, and
consequently not a fitting associate for the daughter of a Church
of England lady.&nbsp; Let me give another illustration.&nbsp; I
have just heard of a clergyman who told a mother that it would be
better to have her child baptized by a Roman priest than by a
Dissenting minister!</p>
<p>I am staying in a gentleman&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; No sooner had
the <i>Orizaba</i> dropped anchor than it was boarded by a
gentleman, who kindly took me off, and away to the railway
station, and personally conducted me over the Blue Mountains by
the celebrated Zigzag Railway, which deserves all that can be
said in its favour.&nbsp; It is a wonderful achievement in the
way of engineering, as it climbs the Blue Mountains, that
favourite health resort of Sydney, on one side, and descends on
the other.&nbsp; In one place you catch sight of the track three
times; you see the line you have left, you see <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>that on
which you travel, and you see, lower down, that on which, in
another moment, you will be travelling.&nbsp; It is wonderful,
but not quite up to the trip over the Alleghanies, and I enjoyed
it, though the heat was great, and the rocks and valleys seemed
as much burnt up as those of Aden itself.</p>
<p>In due time we reached Bathurst, where I was met by a joyous
party of youngsters, who bundled me into a carriage drawn by a
couple of handsome horses, and in a little while I found myself
seated in the charming country residence of the Hon. E. Webb, a
member of the Upper House, who came from Saltash, and who has
certainly gained here both fame and fortune.&nbsp; Bathurst, I
take it, may be considered a fair specimen of an Australian
county town, and the Bathurst people are certainly more devoted
to its welfare than are people at home to that of the localities
in which they reside.&nbsp; The place is laid out with an eye to
the future, and the streets are a great deal broader than our
Portland Place.&nbsp; The houses and shops are rather mixed, some
of them being built of brick, lofty and commodious, while others
are wooden shanties which would not be tolerated at home.&nbsp;
The public buildings are fine.&nbsp; The town is governed by a
mayor and corporation.&nbsp; It has a very handsome court-house,
a magnificent hospital, <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>which is not in debt, and
has&mdash;how unlike our English ones!&mdash;&pound;3,000 to its
credit in the treasurer&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Its churches of all
kinds are good; and even the little churches in which the
Baptists and Independents meet are clean and comfortable.&nbsp;
Out here one would have thought the Baptists and Independents
might have worshipped together; but no, they must meet in
separate bodies, as at home.&nbsp; The Presbyterians have a fine
church, which must have cost a good deal of money, but when I
looked in on Sunday evening the worshippers were a mere
handful.&nbsp; Surely some of these churches might unite, and be
all the stronger for so doing.</p>
<p>The only drawback here is the heat, which does terrible
mischief.&nbsp; We are 2,000 feet above the level of the sea, and
the people call it cool because the thermometer is something
under a hundred in the shade.&nbsp; The clouds come up, but they
bring no rain.&nbsp; At night we have a cool breeze, but,
unfortunately, just as one feels comfortable, and that life is
worth living, everyone goes to bed.&nbsp; Soon after my arrival I
had a country drive.&nbsp; There had been a bush fire, and my
host sent me and one of his nephews to see what amount of
mischief had been done.&nbsp; Away we dashed merrily, drawn by a
pair of young horses that scarcely turned a hair, along the sandy
road, over the <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>rolling downs.&nbsp; Leaving Bathurst behind, we were
soon in what in England we should call a waste, howling
wilderness, and yet a few days of rain would make all that plain
a monster park, where the sheep could graze, and everyone would
rejoice.&nbsp; For miles we saw no living thing, and no sign of
civilization save the fences&mdash;of rails, very high, as the
cattle have a bad habit of jumping them.&nbsp; We met a young
lady riding into Bathurst, holding the horse&rsquo;s reins in one
hand and her parasol in the other, a waggon drawn by ten oxen
coming into the town with wood, and a cart or two&mdash;that was
all.&nbsp; We passed over a fine bridge, but the bed of the river
was dry.&nbsp; Far ahead of us was a cloud of smoke from a
bush-fire, a calamity of constant occurrence in such warm
weather.&nbsp; Soon we were in a forest ourselves, ghastly with
the withered grass and the stumps of old trees not yet decayed,
with the white trunks and grotesque branches twisted in all
directions, but leafless, and gum-trees that are
ring-barked&mdash;the common mode of destroying trees in this
part of the country.&nbsp; Now and then I saw an unfortunate cow,
vainly seeking green grass, or cool water, or the grateful shade,
and half-starved all the while; or a hare, as big again as that
of England, and breeding much more rapidly in this precocious
clime.&nbsp; Presently a couple of magpies <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>passed us,
and they are much larger than at home.&nbsp; But life of any kind
is rare, and we got on to the hillside where the fire had been,
and saw everything black and charred, trees fallen down, fences
only a black line of charcoal.&nbsp; One could fancy that
everything living had fallen a prey to the devouring flame.&nbsp;
Up in the bush, on a hill on our left, there were kangaroos, but
they unfortunately did not put in an appearance; and if I saw
three emus in the course of my ride, candour compels me to own
that they were tame, in a gentleman&rsquo;s grounds, and not in
their native state.&nbsp; The great pests of this part of the
world are the flies.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind them on the table,
if they do make the white sugar apparently a heap of black, or if
they do darken the snow-white tablecloth; it is only when they
proceed to attack the company around that I think they carry
their jokes too far.&nbsp; They are a special torment to the
bald-headed, but they disdain not the fairest of the fair.&nbsp;
The New South Wales flies are smaller than those of the mother
country, and twice as mischievous.&nbsp; To them there is nothing
sacred; and as to the forty winks grateful to many of us after
luncheon or dinner, they are quite out of the question.</p>
<p>The English fruit-grower complains of the wet and cold, the
Australian of the heat and drought.&nbsp; The <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>Ex-Mayor of
Sydney tells me he has lost &pound;10,000 worth of sheep this
season in consequence of the heat; and the charming daughter of
my host, who resides with her husband at a station a hundred and
fifty miles further north&mdash;and in Australia the further you
go north the hotter it becomes&mdash;has been driven away from
her husband, and has to come here with her children because they
have no water nearer than eight miles.&nbsp; As I write I see the
signs of a water famine everywhere, in the dusty road, in the
parched fields, in the distant hills far away.&nbsp; The only
exception is the garden, consisting of many acres beautifully
laid out and well shaded with trees of all kinds.&nbsp; Mr. Webb,
my host, has a tank which conveys the water everywhere, and even
the lawn-tennis ground beyond, to which the young men and maidens
seem as devoted as they are at home, abounds with verdure.&nbsp;
The mansion, for such it is, rises out of a garden of roses and
dahlias, and luxurious flowers, blooming and bright to look on;
while behind are apple and plum and pear and greengage and
mulberry trees laden with luscious fruit to any amount.&nbsp;
Some of the flowers, the stocks, for instance, take far brighter
colours than they do at home; the greengages, too, are finer than
ours, owing to the same reason&mdash;the abundance of sun, a sun
which makes the Australian <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>hornet, with its blue gauze wings,
as black as a coal-heaver.</p>
<p>As to the servants in this house, I dare not say what wages
they are getting.&nbsp; All I know is, that if I were a
lady-help, or even a servant of all-work, it would not be long
ere I booked my passage for New South Wales.&nbsp; The coachman
has a hundred a year and his house, and the gardener not much
less.&nbsp; It is needless to add that I find it good to be here:
it is hard that I must take up my bed and walk.&nbsp; Here no
iron horse screams as he urges on his wild career, no noisy screw
perpetually churns up the troubled sea; I hear no hoarse
watchman, as the hour strikes, proclaiming in the midnight air,
&lsquo;All&rsquo;s well&rsquo;: here no newsboy makes the land
hideous with his noise, nor does the gin-drinking tramp interfere
with my peaceful digestion.&nbsp; Most weary seems the
sea&mdash;</p>
<p
class="gutsumm">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Weary
the oar,<br />
Weary the wandering fields of foam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, like the mild-eyed, melancholy Lotos Eaters, I feel it is
sweet to sit me down upon the yellow sand and</p>
<p
class="gutsumm">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Dream
of Fatherland,<br />
Of child, and wife, and slave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But I am back in Sydney, and seek to study its ways.&nbsp; We
hold the Church of Rome, in all ages and in all <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>countries,
to be the foe of freedom, civil and religious, the great obstacle
in the way of progress, and the worst enemy of God and man; it is
but natural that its growth in New South Wales and all Australia
gives one alarm.&nbsp; It fights with an immense advantage over
its opponents by reason of its wealth, its effective
organization, and its Irish allies, who are banded together for
its support in every colony, and, I may add, in every land.&nbsp;
The only priest I have as yet met with was a model of good-temper
and good-humour, and had an enormous advantage in every way over
his ritualistic ally, who does his work unconsciously, and burns
his fingers by pulling the chestnuts out of the fire for
him.&nbsp; In New South Wales it is understood that the Romanists
are discontented with the existing Education Act, which is
undenominational, and they have supported the Protectionists, not
out of love for them, but with the hope to get some of the public
money for their schools, or, at any rate, modifications, in the
school system which may be favourable to themselves.&nbsp; As it
is, they do not fare badly.&nbsp; The other day it was discovered
that a school teacher had, in spite of his duty to be neutral,
gone out of his way to teach Romanist doctrines to his
pupils.&nbsp; A fuss was made about it, but he was only removed
to another school, that was all.&nbsp; Again, <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>at a place
called Waratah, it has been decided that there shall be no
intramural burials.&nbsp; The principal of the monastery there
writes to the Municipal Council for the privilege to bury members
of the monastery in their own grounds.&nbsp; The Council are
divided, and the Mayor gives the casting vote in favour of the
monastery, that is, in favour of breaking the laws of his
borough.&nbsp; Now, it is very evident that if any Protestant
parson, any Baptist or Wesleyan or Presbyterian, had pleaded for
anything of the kind, that is, for power to break the sanitary
laws of the borough, and to have a private burying-ground of
their own, they would have pleaded in vain.&nbsp; In Victoria,
four or five years ago, there was such an uprising that there has
since been no Catholic party in the House of any size
whatever.&nbsp; It is well to note here that in the eyes of the
State, all over Australia, religions are on an equality.&nbsp;
Under Sir Richard Bourke all religions received State aid; but in
1862 this was put a stop to, and all that the State now does is
to pension off the survivors under the old
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>.&nbsp; In this way last year, in New South
Wales, was divided between the Church of England, the Roman
Catholic Church, the Presbyterians and the Methodists, about
&pound;10,000, the Church of England, as was to be expected,
taking the lion&rsquo;s share.&nbsp; When <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>the
sparseness of the population is considered, the church attendance
will appear very large; and, though apparently less than found in
the colony of Victoria, it is, proportionately, much larger than
in England.&nbsp; In the Bush, the Church of England parsons seem
to be somewhat remiss in the performance of their duties.&nbsp; A
lady residing in the interior tells me that she went to the
Church of England preaching station frequently, but the parson
never turned up, and she had to return unblessed.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took the tramcar&mdash;a Government institution,
by-the-bye&mdash;and had a look at Botany Bay, a place of many
evil memories, and whose associations reach very far, even now
that it has no terrors for the criminal or reprobate.&nbsp; In
reality, Botany Bay was not the penal settlement; that was at
Sydney; but the popular mind believed all the convicts were sent
to Botany Bay, and hence my use of the term.&nbsp; In a recently
published correspondence, a distinguished Victorian judge
asserts: &lsquo;An uneasy and uninformed feeling of suspicious
dislike of England and her Government, which is not without a
justifying cause, undoubtedly exists, and is growing, in these
communities.&nbsp; Its extent is not ascertainable, but it may
safely be affirmed that it will depend largely upon the relations
which yet remain to be acknowledged and to be <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>established
between the Imperial and Colonial Governments of her Majesty in
the immediate future, whether this feeling will not soon expand
among native Australians into one of profound and general
alienation.&rsquo;&nbsp; I think the judge is right, and that
this feeling is growing stronger, finding expression, not in the
old-established papers of the colony, such as <i>The Melbourne
Argus</i> or <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i>, papers of great
wealth and influence, but among their younger and less fortunate
rivals.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was England,&rsquo; writes one of them,
&lsquo;that first seamed the white shoulder of Australia with the
livid mark of the lash.&nbsp; It is the people who wielded that
instrument of degradation, and their descendants, who wish to
draw the bonds of Empire closer to-day.&nbsp; The Imperial
connection is, therefore, a shameful one.&rsquo;&nbsp; Poor
Captain Cook had a good deal to answer for when, in an evil
moment, he first dropped his anchor in Botany Bay.&nbsp; It was
quite a mistake to send out our criminals there; they should have
been allowed, says young Australia, to die of gaol-fever at
home.&nbsp; But, says young Australia, England in her wickedness
did more&mdash;it colonized a continent where the English spirit
of the time was to be perpetuated by the transmitted influence of
the gaolers of these convicts long after a new Liberalism had
entered into British politics, and long after the <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>narrow
spirit of a hundred years ago, with convictism itself, had passed
away.&nbsp; The contention of a growing class in Australia is
that the enduring effect of the convict system on the public
spirit of the older Australian colonies is traceable, not so much
to the convicts themselves, as to their gaolers.&nbsp; These are
the mercenary wretches to be gibbeted for the scorn of every
honest man.&nbsp; These are the gods whom the Australians
ignorantly worship, whose spirit is still strong to deprive the
horny-handed of his rights; who were the founders of the vile
system which actually gives property an influence in making laws,
and in determining the political character of the country; men
who made colossal fortunes by the illegitimate sale of rum.&nbsp;
The chief constable of Sydney had actually a license to sell rum;
and, as Dr. Laing puts it, &lsquo;the chief gaoler, though not
exactly permitted to convert the gaol into a grog shop, had a
licensed house in which he sold rum publicly on his own behalf
right opposite the gaol door.&rsquo;&nbsp; The convicts, it is
admitted, for the sake of argument, were some of them bad; but as
to their gaolers&mdash;the gallant men of the New South Wales
Corps, for instance&mdash;they were all rascals; and they were
the founders of Australia, and their spirit lives and dominates
in the political institutions of the country to this day.&nbsp;
It <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>seems
to me that this is a foul libel on the country, though it is the
indictment put forth by an Australian writer in an Australian
newspaper.&nbsp; Australians are not much given to the study of
history, and perhaps it is well.&nbsp; History is of little avail
when it is treated in this way.&nbsp; Australia was not all
Botany Bay, and its leaders are men whose fathers, by their
character and enterprise and industry, distinguished themselves
in the fair land to which they had come penetrated with English
ideas, with English habits, with the English Bible, with Milton,
and Shakespeare, and Burns; and it is to them, rather than to
Botany Bay, that Australia owes its greatness and its power, its
present flourishing state, its capabilities&mdash;when its mines
are developed, when its vast continent has been opened up by
settlement, and a general system of irrigation&mdash;of a greater
future.&nbsp; It is true, I read in some of the weekly papers,
that Australia is tyrannized over by wealthy imbeciles, while the
high-souled horny-handed is left out in the cold; that the
present state of things is infamous, and must be put an end
to.&nbsp; So far as I can see, the horny-handed is master of the
situation.&nbsp; I admit that he is not a bad fellow.&nbsp; I
wish that he were a little more civil, a little more patriotic,
and that his women-folk were not so egregiously
over-dressed.&nbsp; For his own sake, also, I own <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>that I wish
his better-half knew how to cook a steak and boil a potato.&nbsp;
What I maintain&mdash;and what his admirers will not
admit&mdash;is that the capitalist, the successful working-man,
who has improved himself out of his original poverty, who has
acquired wealth, and all the good it brings with it, is at any
rate his equal.&nbsp; To talk of the taint of Botany Bay is the
silliest of bunkum in the world.&nbsp; There is no trace of it
now.&nbsp; Young Australia knows nothing of transportation.&nbsp;
In Australia you face a new world, a world as new to the writers
filled with tales of the horrors of transportation and gaoler
officialism, and the cringing subservience which it engendered,
as was Botany Bay to Captain Cook, whose monument I see placed in
the park opposite the Sydney Museum.&nbsp; It could not but be
so, when the gold discoveries overran the country with a
population at the rate of 90,000 arrivals in a year&mdash;a mixed
population if you like, but mostly free, and many of them as
manly a set of fellows as any to be met with anywhere.&nbsp; It
is an ill bird that defiles its own nest, and the Australian who
endeavours to make political capital by dwelling on the blunders
of the old country in its efforts to colonize, and thereby
creates an antagonistic feeling to England, does injustice alike
to his own colony and the Fatherland.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>But,
after all, I have said little of Botany Bay itself, which remains
much the same in its natural features as when Cook landed there a
century ago.&nbsp; The tramway plants you on the shore&mdash;all
white sand and dead seaweed.&nbsp; Afar you see the narrow
entrance into the Pacific, along which Cook cautiously steered
his ship, and opposite, on the wooded shore on the other side, is
a small black monument to denote where the great circumnavigator
landed.&nbsp; It is a peaceful spot: woods are all round, the
jerry-builder has neglected the spot altogether, and the
Sydneyite comes here, with his wife and family, for an occasional
mouthful of sea air.&nbsp; On one side of you is a pier, and in
another spot I see an intimation that boats are to be had for
hire, but no boat disturbs the tranquil bay as I wander alone by
the sad sea-shore.&nbsp; To me, meditating, there comes a vision
of the old world, when George III. was living.&nbsp; I see the
black man watching sullenly the new arrivals, frightened by
neither their appearance nor their bullets&mdash;which they fire
just to awaken the native, who returns a shower of arrows.&nbsp;
It is curious how the black has disappeared, how firmly the white
man has planted himself in his seat, and with what bitterness he
has come to regard as an interloper the heathen Chinee&mdash;who
seems to muster pretty strongly in the busy, half-built territory
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>that
stretches from the bay to the capital.&nbsp; As I get into the
train I am sandwiched between two celestials, so I dream
visions.&nbsp; Is the world for the future to be given up to the
Mongolian?&nbsp; Is the Caucasian played out?&nbsp; Not exactly,
I fancy; at any rate, as far as Australia is concerned.</p>
<p>In South Wales nothing is more remarkable than the
elevation&mdash;social, political, and religious&mdash;of the
people, within little more than a single generation.&nbsp; In
1845 Dr. Darwin published his last edition of &lsquo;The Voyage
of the <i>Beagle</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the course of his voyage he
landed at Sydney, and writes: &lsquo;On the whole, from what I
have heard more than from what I saw, I was disappointed with the
state of society.&nbsp; The whole community is rancorously
divided into parties on almost every subject.&nbsp; Among those
who from their station in life ought to be the best, many live in
such open profligacy that respectable people cannot live with
them.&nbsp; There is much jealousy between the children of the
rich emancipist and the free settlers, the former being pleased
to consider honest men as interlopers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Darwin also
refers to the mischief done to the children by the degraded class
of servants by whom they are surrounded.&nbsp; In the New South
Wales of to-day, not only do you see nothing of this, but quite
the reverse.&nbsp; It forms the grandest <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>illustration the world has yet seen of the tendency of
human society to elevate and reform itself.</p>
<p>I would also say something of the country.&nbsp; New South
Wales is not dependent solely on its harbour nor its Blue
Mountains for beauty.&nbsp; I heard everywhere much of the beauty
of the Hunter River district, and the richness of its soil, but I
regret I was unable to visit it.&nbsp; I did go, however, to the
Hawkesbury River, not a long ride by rail from Sydney&mdash;the
Rhine of New South Wales, as Mr. Trollope terms it.&nbsp; It is
not the Rhine, no more than is the Hudson River of New
York.&nbsp; Both are charming rivers for a day&rsquo;s outing,
but they are not the Rhine with its old castles, its vine-clad
hills, its legendary lore.&nbsp; There is but one Rhine in the
world, as there is but one Thames.&nbsp; However, on the
Hawkesbury you have lovely scenery, tranquil waters, wooded
hills, a beauteous solitude, an air of repose, which make one
realize how divine is Nature and all her works.&nbsp; It was good
to be there.&nbsp; It was with regret that I tore myself
away.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">AMONGST THE BANANA BOYS.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Collision in Sydney
Harbour&mdash;Brisbane&mdash;The Banana Boys&mdash;Sir Samuel
Griffith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> is too hot for any
Englishman to go to Sydney in January and February,&rsquo; said a
gentleman to me on board the <i>Orizaba</i>&mdash;but I
went.&nbsp; At Sydney everyone said it was too hot to think of
going to Brisbane&mdash;but I went; and in either case I should
have missed a great deal of pleasure had I stayed away.&nbsp; The
misfortune was that I went by the <i>Warrago</i> to Brisbane, a
favourite boat, and the crowd was so great I had to sleep in the
dining-saloon; but the trip was enjoyable.&nbsp; In the first
place, to start with, we had a real collision at sea, and I had
time to calculate what my chances were of ever seeing my native
land again as I watched with not a little interest the attacking
vessel steering steadily for our <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>steamer&rsquo;s side.&nbsp;
Fortunately she got the worst of it, as her foresail and bowsprit
came tumbling down, and we made our way out in safety.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think anyone was to blame.&nbsp; The fact was, just
as we were starting a Melbourne ship, the <i>Barcoo</i>, was
leaving the wharf.&nbsp; Between us was an unhappy schooner laden
with coal, and her choice lay simply between Scylla and
Charybdis.&nbsp; The former she cleared; the latter she ran
into.&nbsp; Methinks I heard her infuriated captain, as he looked
athwart his damaged barque, scream out something disrespectful
concerning land-lubbers.&nbsp; Our gallant captain, however, in a
conversation with me on the subject, explained that the other
party was entirely in the wrong.&nbsp; Be that as it may, it
seemed to me rather hard that the only occasion on which, as he
told me, he ever met with an accident should have been when I was
on board.</p>
<p>Our trip was vastly agreeable, as we saw a good deal of the
Australian coast under very favourable circumstances, the sea
being calm and the skies bright.&nbsp; In about thirty-six hours
we had reached the mouth of Moreton Bay, a fine sheet of water,
with the conical hills on our right which Cook called &lsquo;the
Glass Houses,&rsquo; and then by a narrow channel we made our way
into the river on which Brisbane stands, and which bears its
name.&nbsp; When the tide is up <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>the Brisbane river is almost as
romantic as our lovely Dart, and a good deal more so than our
far-famed Orwell.&nbsp; Only think of mangroves growing right up
from the water for miles, of banks where the bananas ripen, and
where you can pluck juicy mangoes from the stalk (on the top of
the banks I saw the graceful bamboo), where strange flowers
bloomed and strange birds shrieked (the native Australian bird
never sings), where the pineapple (they were selling them at
Brisbane at a penny each) grows in the open, and where actually I
saw for the first time the sugarcane reared in the field, and
felt as Alice must have felt in Wonderland.</p>
<p>Queensland, the youngest, promises to be the most flourishing
of the colonies.&nbsp; It was not till 1859 that it was known to
the world as Queensland; up to that time it had formed a portion
of New South Wales.&nbsp; Queensland is still open to emigrants,
and its Government lends a helping hand, unlike the other
colonies, to emigrants of the right sort.&nbsp; On the Darling
plains they can live in comfort, but, alas! they cannot all
expect to settle there.&nbsp; It is in the north that the most
astonishing progress has been within the last quarter of a
century, and alas! the north is hot&mdash;hotter than the average
Englishman can stand.&nbsp; Mining and sugar-growing are the
leading industries <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>of the north.&nbsp; In many instances the former has
proved the primary factor in the opening of new territory, and in
the extension of trade to ports in the higher latitudes.&nbsp;
Notable instances of this may be seen to-day in the townships of
Cooktown and Cairns, which owe their origin entirely to the
goldfields of the Palmer and Hodgkinson.&nbsp; In the case of the
latter, the discovery of the extremely fruitful nature of the
soil has induced settlement, and agriculture is looked upon as
one of the principal means of ensuring a thriving future.&nbsp;
Brisbane is not as remarkable as either Melbourne or
Sydney.&nbsp; To begin with, it has only a population of some
74,000, though it is the capital of 668,224 square miles.&nbsp;
They can grow everything, apparently, and find everything, for
its mineral treasures are beyond conception.&nbsp; It is
Queensland that owns the great Morgan Mine which just now has
turned everybody&rsquo;s head; but in no part of Australia have I
seen so much that tells of growth and progress.&nbsp; All over
the place they are pulling down the old shanties and erecting
fine buildings in their stead, of stone white as marble.&nbsp;
Outside, the suburbs are pretty, and land is cheap at
&pound;1,500 an acre.&nbsp; The Houses of Parliament are
stately.&nbsp; The Governor has a handsome residence, and the
public gardens are extensive and form an <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>agreeable
promenade, before the too hot sun rises, along the river&rsquo;s
bank.&nbsp; Afar, forming a landmark, as it were, is an enormous
white building, known as All Hallows Convent.&nbsp; I was more
interested in the Reformatory, on our left, where, unlike our
own, the lads are reformed, not returned to society harder and
wickeder than ever.&nbsp; The streets are fairly wide, and some
of the shops are handsome.&nbsp; It is a busy place.&nbsp; The
town is full of hotels, and, led by the lust of gold, people ever
come and go.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are Banana boys,&rsquo; said a young Queenslander to
me as we steamed up the river, looking over at the muddy sediment
they call whales&rsquo; spawn.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have some smart
men among us.&nbsp; Look,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;there is
one,&rsquo; as he pointed to a tall, light-haired gentleman in
gray clothes and soft felt hat&mdash;something of the figure of
Sir Fowell Buxton.&nbsp; Happily I had no need to have pointed
out to me Sir Samuel Griffith, late Premier of Queensland and the
head of its Bar.&nbsp; I had introduced myself to him soon after
we left Sydney, and never did I meet with a more friendly
acquaintance.&nbsp; Naturally, at first he seemed, as he viewed
me through his eyeglass, a little suspicious, as are most
Colonials, and as they are bound to be when you remember the
tales they have to hear, and the doubtful characters who force
themselves on their <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>notice.&nbsp; But as we chatted away
his reserve relaxed, and he became the charming companion, ready
to describe all the country round, and to show me all the
kindness in his power.&nbsp; As we stood on the deck he pointed
to a handsome white brick-built bungalow rising out of a fine
extent of lawn and garden, overlooking the river, with which it
was connected.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is my house,&rsquo; said he, at
the same time inviting me to dine there that night&mdash;an offer
which, it is needless to say, I gladly accepted.&nbsp; In due
time I reached Merthyr, as Sir Samuel names his residence, from
the place in old Wales where he was born, and where, on his
recent visit home, he was received with a cordiality such as
gallant little Wales only extends once in a way to her most
distinguished sons.&nbsp; He, the poor Dissenting
minister&rsquo;s son, then the Premier of Queensland, and still
the greatest man in the colony&mdash;for I never knew a fallen
statesman so beloved&mdash;was the guest at Cyfartha
Castle.&nbsp; I know not why he has gone out of office, but I
think the cause is not far to seek.&nbsp; Queensland is split up
into two separate camps&mdash;the North, who want coloured labour
to work on the sugar plantations, a work for which no white man
is fit; and the South, who say the black labour of the North is
really slavery, and who object to it in every form.&nbsp; To the
pretensions <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>of the North Sir Samuel has ever been sternly opposed;
and then he had held office five years&mdash;and democracies are
always fickle.&nbsp; So Sir Samuel is now the leader of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Opposition, and is as much respected and as
strong almost as ever.&nbsp; There is an air of refinement about
him which tells even with the Banana boys, who look as brown and
burnt up as it is possible for men to be.&nbsp; They seem
determined men, with felt hats of every shape and colour, with
hands that seem never to have known the mysteries of soap and
water&mdash;men who have done yeomen&rsquo;s work at the
diggings, or on the sheep farm&mdash;and give you a shake which
reminds one strongly of the &lsquo;horny-handed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ah,
they told me some strange tales of the blacks in the little
smoke-room of the steamer by which we returned, and would have
told me more had it not come on to blow so hard that we were all
compelled to go to bed.&nbsp; They all rejected Sir
Samuel&rsquo;s policy, as an injury to the North, but they all
loved the man, of whom we shall, I doubt not, soon hear
again.&nbsp; He is young, as men go&mdash;almost too young, you
would think, for the power he has grasped.&nbsp; I do not blame
him that he resolved to fight out his battle in Queensland rather
than return to England to take Henry Richard&rsquo;s place as
M.P. for Merthyr, as he was invited to do.&nbsp; <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>In this
respect the father resembles the son.&nbsp; Brisbane is his
home.&nbsp; He has reached the term of three score years and ten,
and he now holds the pulpit of the Congregationalist chapel at
Brisbane till the people have appointed his successor.&nbsp; The
day before I reached Brisbane there had been a meeting of his
friends to do him honour, and the old man was well pleased at it,
as I found from a short talk with him in his pleasant home, not
far from his son&rsquo;s ampler residence.&nbsp; The ex-Premier
is not a man to be idle.&nbsp; He has faced the problem of the
day&mdash;the perpetual struggle between want and
wealth&mdash;and has something to say on the matter.&nbsp; Hardly
a care seemed to cloud his brow, hardly a wish to be left
unsatisfied.&nbsp; He seemed to me alike sound in head and heart,
as we sat smoking under the veranda of his handsome bungalow,
under the Southern Cross, with the river running at our feet,
with the cry of want and woe silent, with the sound of the
distant city hushed, while the moonlight, stealing over the
scene, had blended with the lights of eve.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">SOUTH AUSTRALIA.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Holy Adelaide&mdash;Its Situation&mdash;Its
Public Buildings&mdash;Its Mining-market&mdash;Dr.
Arnold&mdash;Australian Plagues: Fleas and Mosquitoes and
Serpents&mdash;Sunday Observance&mdash;The Macleay
Mission&mdash;Number of Churches.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> Adelaide, from which I now
write, can claim to be called &lsquo;the Holy,&rsquo; is one of
these things no &lsquo;fellah&rsquo; can understand.&nbsp; It may
be because it is near Paradise, to which, I see, there is a daily
service of trains, but which I have not yet visited, partly
because I have a conviction that it is a place for which I am not
yet ripe, and partly because at present my time is better
occupied.&nbsp; Through the kindness of Chief Justice Way, the
Acting-Governor of South Australia <i>pro tem.</i>, I am an
honorary member of the Adelaide Club, and what with the English
magazines and newspapers&mdash;long denied me&mdash;and the
members of the club to talk to, I am perfectly <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>contented
to forego the joys of Paradise awhile.&nbsp; Chief Justice Way
deserves a chapter to himself as the Mec&aelig;nas of South
Australia&mdash;the best of good company, as a host
unsurpassed.&nbsp; It is said that he would have been Sir Samuel
had he been a Churchman; but one can scarce believe that, in a
land where religions are equal.&nbsp; Adelaide is a beautiful
city, laid out with broad streets and public parks to the best
advantage.&nbsp; It seemed to me, as I landed from the
<i>Austral</i> and took the train at the end of the pier in Largs
Bay, that I had got into as stale and sandy a bit of country as
ever I saw in my life.&nbsp; However, appearances improved as I
passed through the busy port and entered the city, which I like
better the more I see of it.&nbsp; As you may imagine by the
name, the place is of recent origin.&nbsp; It was founded in
1834, and in 1836 it became the residence of a governor, and then
the site of the present city was fixed on.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
situated,&rsquo; wrote one of the officials, &lsquo;on gently
rising ground on both banks of a pretty stream, reaching down to
the sea, over which south-west breezes blow nine months out of
the twelve with invigorating freshness.&nbsp; At the back is a
beautifully-wooded country, which extends for about six miles, to
the first range of hills.&nbsp; The hills seem to surround the
town, except where they melt, as it were, into <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>the sand of
the seashore.&rsquo;&nbsp; The then existing woods, however, have
been cut down, and all along the plain are the homes of the
citizens.&nbsp; You see few fine houses&mdash;mostly they are
small&mdash;one story&mdash;with iron roofs and little gardens,
where the inhabitants grow a few flowers and spend their evenings
under the veranda, smoking or reading, as it seems good in their
eyes.&nbsp; In one of them I found an old friend whom I had not
seen for forty-five years.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you remember
me?&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; was the reply, as he
mentioned my name.&nbsp; The fact is, he had seen that I was in
Australia by the newspapers, and he fully expected I would
call.&nbsp; Alas! his wife was less quick in recognising my manly
form.&nbsp; In Adelaide you see little of the rush and excitement
which make Melbourne and Sydney famous.&nbsp; It has a university
and educational endowments, and newspapers in abundance.&nbsp;
Where I am located, I look out on the palm-trees which decorate
the Governor&rsquo;s residence, and a little further on are the
fine buildings known as the Public Library and Museum, and beyond
them are the Botanical Gardens, well worthy of a visit, though
less beautifully situated than those of Sydney.&nbsp; On my left
is the railway-station and the new Houses of Parliament, and the
road which leads down to the Torrens Lake, across which a
handsome bridge has <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>been thrown, and where the young
athletes of the city spend their summer evenings.&nbsp; I walk up
King William Street, with its Town Hall and Post-office, all
white, as are most of the houses and grand offices in the wide
streets, and pass Victoria Square, on the other side of which are
the Law Courts.&nbsp; The buildings devoted to religious purposes
are many, and in one of them preaches the Rev. R. Fletcher, a
powerful-looking man intellectually, in the prime of life, and
the principal of the new college the Congregationalists are about
to establish.&nbsp; He gathers around him an influential and very
respectable congregation (about a dozen of his hearers are
Members of Parliament), but, like all the rest of the
city-pastors, both at home and in Australia, Mr. Fletcher finds
yearly he loses old hearers, who move into the suburbs, and their
vacant seats are left unoccupied.&nbsp; The Bishop of the city,
Dr. Kennion, is highly spoken of.&nbsp; Here, as at home, and all
over Australia, there are Christians of all sorts, nor are the
members of the Salvation Army conspicuous by their absence.&nbsp;
The dream of Christian unity seems in Australia as far off
realization as at home.&nbsp; One Church parson with whom I have
come in contact is a fine specimen of the muscular
Christian.&nbsp; He is a canon of the Church, and is immensely
popular as a <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>preacher and a man.&nbsp; The following anecdote is
characteristic: Once upon a time he was troubled at finding his
stack of firewood rapidly diminishing.&nbsp; As it was not burnt
in the house, he concluded it was taken off by a thief.&nbsp; To
detect him was the proper thing, and the worthy canon sat for a
night or two to wait for the enemy.&nbsp; Nor had he long to
wait, as he appeared in the shape of a sailor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the divine, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll fight for
it.&nbsp; If you beat me, I will let you off; if I beat you, I
will give you in charge.&rsquo;&nbsp; They did fight, and the
sailor got such a licking as he never had before.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
the story true?&rsquo; I said to the canon.&nbsp; He shook his
head, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a sad
tale!&rsquo;&nbsp; Evidently in his heart he was proud of his
pluck, and well he may be; many a one goes to hear him preach who
would have kept away had he not been as ready with his fists as
eloquent of tongue.</p>
<p>As I pass up King William Street, I see what is called the
Royal Exchange.&nbsp; I enter, and behold an eager and excited
mob.&nbsp; They are all men&mdash;most of them are smoking, in
spite of an announcement to the effect that smoking is strictly
forbidden.&nbsp; I point out the notice to one of the smokers,
and he only smiles.&nbsp; What are they about?&nbsp; Buying and
selling mining shares.&nbsp; This seems to be the leading
industry <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>of the place, and they buy and sell hereto the extent
of &pound;300,000 or &pound;400,000 a year.&nbsp; A broker
explains to me that it is a safe way of making money if you are
not frightened, but keep your shares, and if you deal with a
broker who has no shares of his own to sell.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you
do,&rsquo; adds my informant, &lsquo;there is no telling what a
mess you may be drawn into.&rsquo;&nbsp; I thank him, and leave
him, regretting that I have no money to invest, as I am certain
to win if I take his kindly and disinterested advice.&nbsp; In
the evening I find the business still in full swing.&nbsp; It is
eight o&rsquo;clock, and the Exchange is shut up, but my friend
the broker is still playing his little game.&nbsp; He has changed
the venue, that is all.&nbsp; I pass through a long passage at
the end of an hotel; I descend a few steps, and am in a large
room.&nbsp; On one side my friend stands in a Lilliputian
rostrum, with his hammer in his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,
gentlemen,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;now is your time&mdash;ten
Junction Shares, buyer at eleven and three&mdash;seller at eleven
and six&mdash;come on, gentlemen but the gentlemen don&rsquo;t
seem much inclined to come on.&nbsp; They are a sleepy
lot&mdash;leaning or sitting all round the room.&nbsp; At length
says one of the crowd, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take that,&rsquo; and
the auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer rings sharply on the desk.&nbsp;
And thus the evening wears away, till the lot is gone
through.&nbsp; No one is excited&mdash;no large <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>fortunes
are here lost or won.&nbsp; Everything is on a small scale, and
it is to be hoped that the buyers know what they are about.&nbsp;
The auctioneer, a little man with a diamond ring glittering on
his finger, evidently does.&nbsp; As to mines, all Adelaide is
interested in them.&nbsp; In almost every shop you see specimens
of ore displayed of some kind or other, no matter what the
business of the shop may be.&nbsp; But, oh! the loveliness of the
night as I reascend the steps, and leave the little knot of
speculators behind.&nbsp; The shops are closed.&nbsp; The streets
are almost deserted.&nbsp; There are no crowds of loafers and
larrikins as in Melbourne or Sydney.&nbsp; There is scarce a
living being at the bars besides the keeper or his girl.&nbsp;
The shadows of the trees fall on the broad pavement.&nbsp; On the
other side the white houses glisten in the moonlight, for the
moon pours out a silvery flood of glory, almost hiding the stars
of the blue sky above.&nbsp; It must be some such night as this
that suggested the idea to the man who first ventured to speak of
Holy Adelaide.&nbsp; Even the hills far away seem to live anew as
they revive the silence and the splendour of a long-forgotten
past.</p>
<p>In general intelligence, according to an interesting report
just published by the Inspector-General of Victorian
Schools&mdash;in general intelligence, the children of the large
towns in the three colonies are very much <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>alike.&nbsp; In New South Wales a higher standard is
aimed at than in the other colonies.&nbsp; Victoria spends a
considerable amount of money in establishing scholarships, so as
to enable the most promising of State scholars to pass through
the secondary schools; but in the senior colony Euclid, Algebra,
and Latin or French form part of the ordinary course of
instruction in the fifth class of the elementary public
schools.&nbsp; The attempt is to do much&mdash;too much in too
little time.&nbsp; In South Australia an opposite policy
prevails.&nbsp; The teachers of the three colonies display on the
whole equal industry and care.&nbsp; In the large city schools
children over fourteen years of age show nearly equal proficiency
in Victoria and South Australia in the ordinary subjects of
primary instruction, and rather less in New South Wales.&nbsp;
Children about thirteen are about equal in the three
colonies.&nbsp; Children between eleven and twelve are the most
proficient in South Australia, and the least in Victoria.&nbsp;
If attainments in Algebra, Euclid, Latin, and French are taken
into account, New South Wales has the best results to show.&nbsp;
In New South Wales the teachers are paid a fixed salary.&nbsp; In
Victoria the system of payment by results is wholly, in South
Australia partially, adopted.&nbsp; Observations tend to show
that the bad effect of payment by results is <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>quite as
conspicuous where the system prevails as where it does not.</p>
<p>In 1829 England was taking rather a rosy view of the
unfortunate Swan River Settlement.&nbsp; It ended, as most of us
know, in disastrous failure.&nbsp; But it was put before the
public in an attractive form, or we should not find the great Dr.
Arnold writing from Rugby to his friend the Rev. I. Tucker:
&lsquo;If we are alive fifteen years hence I think I would go
gladly to Swan River if they will make me schoolmaster there, and
lay my bones in the land of kangaroos and opossums.&nbsp; My
notion is that no missionizing is half so beneficial as to try to
pour sound and healthy blood into a young civilized society, to
make one colony, if possible, like the ancient colonies in New
England&mdash;a living sucker from the mother country, bearing
the same blossoms and the same fruits; not a reproduction of its
vilest excrescences, its ignorance, while all the good qualities
are left behind in the process.&nbsp; No words can tell the evil
of such colonies as we have hitherto planted, where the best
parts of the new society have been men too poor to carry with
them or to gain much of the higher branches of knowledge, or else
mere official functionaries from England, whose hearts and minds
have been always half at home, and who have never identified
themselves <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>with the land in which they were working.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Arnold did well to remain where he was.&nbsp; In the Swan Colony
immense blocks of land were freely granted to settlers,
regardless of their means to profitably occupy such
holdings.&nbsp; As a consequence, the farmers had no labourers to
till the soil, and many of the large estates lay waste, or only
supported a few head of cattle.&nbsp; It was in South Australia,
if anywhere, an attempt was made to realize Dr. Arnold&rsquo;s
ideal.&nbsp; It was started on the Wakefield system, which worked
well for a time, and attracted the right men into the land.&nbsp;
It was resolved that it should be free from the taint of felony,
and it was resolved that it should have no State Church; and the
spirit of the founders still permeates the land.&nbsp; At any
rate, in Adelaide I found better society than I did anywhere
else.</p>
<p>Leaving Adelaide on my way home, I must speak of a few of the
blots of Australian life.&nbsp; When Paul tells us he fought with
beasts at Ephesus, we feel inclined to pity the unfortunate
saint; but when people talk of mosquitoes that is quite another
matter, and yet I know not whether it is worst to fight with
beasts at Ephesus than to wrestle with mosquitoes all through the
watches of the night, as I did at Melbourne.&nbsp; At Sydney I
was told they would worry me to death, but there they left me
unharmed.&nbsp; At Melbourne I <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>was informed, on unexceptionable
authority, that the mosquitoes would not annoy me at all, and it
was with a light heart that I went to bed, little dreaming that I
should rise a sadder and a wiser man on the morrow&mdash;a
spectacle for gods and men&mdash;with all the blood sucked out of
my body, and prematurely gray.&nbsp; I know that I am a sinner; I
know that I have done the things which I ought not to have done,
and left undone the things which I should have done; I know (as
Shakespeare tells us) if we all had our deserts there would be
none of us who would escape whipping; I have written, I own, a
good deal of indifferent prose and poetry, have kept late hours,
and have seen a good deal of the wicked world&mdash;a moderate
amount of punishment I am prepared for.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a man
soweth that shall he also reap,&rsquo; is a law that runs through
life, and for wise and salutary ends.&nbsp; But it was hard,
nevertheless, to have to fight with such paltry, insignificant
creatures as mosquitoes&mdash;mere stings on Lilliputian wings,
too ridiculous to be considered as enemies&mdash;yet I own they
kept me awake all one night, as they tortured me from the crown
of my head to the sole of my foot, and made me tremble and
perspire as I heard them trumpeting previous to a general attack
as I never had done before.&nbsp; I never felt so savage; I never
saw my poor body so cut up <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>with scars.&nbsp; I was to dine next
day with one of the handsomest ladies in Melbourne, a fine
specimen of an Irish beauty, to whom I was anxious to present
myself in as respectable a plight as possible; but all was of no
avail.&nbsp; Mercifully, however, the brutes so gorged themselves
that I was enabled to take a righteous revenge; but it was an
awful night, and I felt how David must have had them in his eye
when he longed, in one of his grand psalms, for the wings of a
dove, to fly away and be at rest.</p>
<p>Alas, alas! if we have the mosquitoes by night, there are also
flies which are a real terror by day, especially in places of
worship, where they seriously interfere alike with the
inattentive or the attentive hearer.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t seem
to interest themselves much in the preliminary part of the
service&mdash;they are conspicuous by their absence in singing
and chanting, and there is a good deal of both in
Australia&mdash;but immediately the text is announced and you
have settled yourself down in an attitude of repose the attack
commences.&nbsp; At first you heed it not&mdash;it seems too
ridiculous to be bothered by a fly.&nbsp; At last your blood
boils, and you can stand it no longer.&nbsp; The tiny tormentor
flies into your mouth, should it perchance be open, settles on
the most sensitive part of your nose, assails your forehead,
attacks your ears, <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>and every other vulnerable point.&nbsp; You give a
bang, but you have missed your mark; your enemy is beyond your
reach, only to return with fresh vigour to the attack.&nbsp; Not
a moment does he leave you at rest; not a moment can you listen
in peace and comfort; not a moment, while the sermon lasts, are
you in a proper, Christian frame of mind.&nbsp; When I went to
hear Dr. Strong, the great Australian heretic, the fly&mdash;for
providentially, as a rule, it is only one fly that attacks you at
a time&mdash;was especially active.&nbsp; That fly must have
belonged to the ranks of the orthodox, and thought I deserved
little mercy for once in my lifetime straying from the
fold.&nbsp; At any rate, little mercy he showed to me.&nbsp; A
minor nuisance is the Australian cricket, which commences to make
an extraordinary row as the sun goes down.&nbsp; Another nuisance
are the song-birds, as they call them.&nbsp; Sitting one day in
the Sydney Botanical Gardens&mdash;very beautiful, but not so
fine as those of Melbourne&mdash;I was startled as if all the
grinding machinery in the colony had been put in motion to set my
teeth on edge.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; I asked in
alarm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only the birds singing,&rsquo; was the
somewhat unsatisfactory reply.</p>
<p>An interesting table has been published which purports to give
the Drink Bill of Australasia for 1887.&nbsp; The statement has
been prepared by the Victorian <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Alliance, and although it is not
easy to conjecture how some of the information has been obtained,
it may at least be assumed from its authorship that the amount of
the Bill has not been kept unreasonably low.&nbsp; Assuming it to
be correct, we find that the several colonies spent
&pound;15,582,485 on their liquor in 1887, representing an outlay
of &pound;4 8s. 6d. for each man, woman, and child alive in that
year.&nbsp; Western Australia spent more in proportion to her
population than any of her sister colonies, her bill amounting to
&pound;6 10s. per head.&nbsp; Next comes Queensland at a
respectable distance, with &pound;5 9s. 4d. per head, closely
followed by Victoria with &pound;5 5s.&nbsp; New South Wales pays
&pound;4 10s. 3d., Tasmania, &pound;3 6s. 7d., and New Zealand,
&pound;3 5s.&nbsp; South Australia modestly brings up the rear
with an average payment per head of only &pound;2 19s.</p>
<p>Sunday in Adelaide is the <i>beau ideal</i> of the Puritan
Sabbath.&nbsp; The other Australian cities attempt something of
the kind, but in Adelaide the thing has been achieved, and except
for Christian workers in the pulpit or the Sunday-school the day
is emphatically one of rest.&nbsp; Somehow or other the Sunday
seems in keeping with the place.&nbsp; At no time does Adelaide
strike you as a city of business.&nbsp; The air is too pure, the
sky too <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>lovely, the streets too clean.&nbsp; About lunch time
there seems to be a little pressure in the streets, and a little
business in the shops; at the club we are quite full at that
sacred hour, and under the veranda in the tiny square behind,
where we boast a couple of fern palms, a fountain, and one gold
fish, the smokers congregate, while the click of the balls
indicates the presence of company in the billiard-room
adjoining.&nbsp; But to-day the only people about are the
church-goers.&nbsp; I followed the crowd to the Stowe Memorial
Church, in Flinders Street.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Quinton Stowe,
who was born at Hadleigh, in Suffolk, must have had much to do
with the building up of the Adelaide of to-day.&nbsp; The church
of which he was the pastor was established at a meeting held in a
tent, provided by the Colonial Missionary Society, in December,
1837, with Mr. Stowe for its first pastor.&nbsp; The next
building was a sanctuary of pine and reeds, erected in North
Terrace.&nbsp; The church grew with the growth of the colony, and
in 1840 removed to a large square building in Freeman
Street.&nbsp; There Mr. Stowe remained till advancing age hinted
retirement.&nbsp; In 1862 he died, leaving behind him the useful
memory of a devoted life.&nbsp; No name is more connected with
the religious history of the colony.&nbsp; He was trusted by all
for his sincerity, honoured for his wisdom, <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>respected
for his talents, and beloved for his piety.&nbsp; The Church,
wishing to commemorate his name, and being in need of a new and
larger place of assembly, built the Stowe Memorial Church, the
foundation-stone of which was laid in 1865 by the Hon. Alexander
Hay, and which was opened for public worship in 1867.&nbsp; It is
a large and handsome building, erected in Flinders Street, where
the Presbyterians and Baptists also have places of worship.&nbsp;
It was a relief to turn into it, when I was there, out of the
scorching sun.&nbsp; There is no gallery, but the area is very
large, and the buildings in connection with the place are
numerous, and ornamental as well as useful.&nbsp; They consist of
a lecture-hall, a schoolroom, and attendant class-rooms.&nbsp; In
1876 the Rev. Wm. Roby Fletcher, of Richmond, Melbourne, accepted
the call of the people and became pastor.&nbsp; It was at his
handsome home, a little way out of town&mdash;surrounded by books
and curios&mdash;that I supped after the evening service.&nbsp;
His wife is an Australian lady.&nbsp; He is specially learned in
Indian subjects, where he was sent by the Government to study its
educational system, and from which he has not long
returned.&nbsp; In Adelaide Mr. Fletcher occupies high rank.</p>
<p>One thing that may be said of him is that he is ready to
utilise passing events.&nbsp; In the week there <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>had been a
tragedy in Adelaide of a very painful character.&nbsp; There had
been a fire in a temperance coffee-palace, and of the guests a
Mr. Taplin had been burnt to death.&nbsp; Mr. Taplin was a fine,
stalwart man, of imposing presence, and well-known to the public
as the head of the Point Macleay Mission to the Blacks, which was
founded by his father, the Rev. G. Taplin.&nbsp; The father was
one of the first arrivals in the colony, and meeting a
black-fellow as he stepped ashore, he conceived the idea that
with religious and industrial training something might be done
with the aborigines.&nbsp; He lost no time or opportunity in
giving practical effect to his convictions, and in due time he
found himself superintendent of the Aboriginal Farm and Mission
Station, where he toiled till his death in 1879, having in the
meantime wrought a wonderful improvement in the condition of the
blacks, and exhibited many proofs of the controverted point that
the aborigines are capable of receiving and understanding a
higher form of spiritual knowledge than that in which they were
bred.&nbsp; The blacks loved him with their whole hearts, and
admired him as a sort of demigod.&nbsp; One of them, when
questioned by a carping critic as to the existence of a Deity,
replied, &lsquo;You know Massa Taplin, and then you no fear
plenty believe&rsquo;n God.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>The
senior Mr. Taplin was not only a practical agriculturist,
architect, and jack-of-all-trades, as it were, but he was as well
a man of much learning and piety.&nbsp; His acquaintance with the
art of healing was only equalled by his deep knowledge of
Australian philology.&nbsp; When the father died he was succeeded
by his son William, who, though he dropped the title of reverend,
followed in his father&rsquo;s steps.&nbsp; He was a Catholic
Christian, excelling in preaching as much as in the physical
exercises of the natives.&nbsp; He was recognised as public
vaccinator of the district.&nbsp; In the harder manual work he
kept abreast of the times, and only recently the Mission
Committee undertook, under his direction, to carry out some
much-needed irrigation work on the reserve.&nbsp; He had come to
Adelaide to discuss with the committee the concerns of the
mission, and he gave a lecture before the Australian Natives
Association, on &lsquo;Our Aboriginals: Their Manners and
Customs; or, a Native Fifty Years Ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; He overslept
himself, and that necessitated another night in Adelaide; and
then came the tragic end, all the more tragical as he was the
only one of the guests who knew the way of escape, which leads to
the supposition that he must have lost his own life in saving the
lives of others.&nbsp; It was on his death that Mr. Fletcher
based his <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>discourse.&nbsp; It was listened to by a congregation
attentive and highly respectable as regards appearance.&nbsp; As
to the church itself: inside it is very spacious, and, not being
disfigured by galleries, presents almost a cathedral-like
appearance.&nbsp; In the evening I heard from afar the band of
the Salvation Army.&nbsp; They are in Adelaide as everywhere
else.&nbsp; I should have thought that the Army might have been
more usefully employed elsewhere.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go
far in Adelaide,&rsquo; said a man in the street to me,
&lsquo;without seeing a church.&nbsp; There are about four in
every street.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps this explains the fact why
Adelaide is called &lsquo;holy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alas! in England we
often say, &lsquo;the nearer the church the further from
God!&rsquo;</p>

166</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LIFE AT A STATION.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Dooleete&rsquo;s
Station&mdash;Sheep-shearing&mdash;Patriarchal Life
improved&mdash;Snakes&mdash;Drought.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">did</span> not see much of station life
in Australia.&nbsp; I was to have visited Mr. Angas&rsquo;s in
South Australia, one of the show-places of the colony, but the
heat prevented me.&nbsp; However, Mr. Dooleete, of Adelaide, very
kindly took me to one he has in conjunction with a friend, about
100 miles from Adelaide, and I much enjoyed the trip.&nbsp; We
started early in the morning from Mr. Dooleete&rsquo;s romantic
residence among the hills, and were swiftly carried to the
junction where the Melbourne train arrives.&nbsp; From here we
were to take with us a gentleman who was purchasing horses for
the Indian Government, Australia having a breed of horses
particularly suited for our cavalry out there.&nbsp; A gentleman
in Adelaide told me, when his father <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>was a Congregational minister at
Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s, in Suffolk, he persuaded the eccentric
Rowland Hill to come and preach for him.&nbsp; There being no
Great Eastern Railway in those days, Mr. Hill travelled, as was
his wont, in his carriage and pair, and was naturally anxious as
to who was to look after his horses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the minister, &lsquo;they will be taken
care of by a member of my church&mdash;a horse-dealer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; said Rowland Hill, lifting up his hands in
amazement; &lsquo;a horse-dealer a member of a Christian Church!
who ever heard of such a thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The horse-dealer who joined our party was, if not a member of
a Christian Church, at any rate a particularly good judge of a
horse, and was at once able to recognise the animal he considered
useful for his work.</p>
<p>It was a pretty country through which we travelled.&nbsp; Here
and there we came to a station, around which was rising up a
small town; but mainly we saw nothing but forest and scrub with
few signs of life.&nbsp; We stopped at a small town situated on
Lake Alexandria, and, after lunching at an hotel kept by a worthy
colonist from Essex, who seemed perfectly contented with his lot,
we got on board a small yacht, <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the management of which was left to
bulky blacks belonging to the mission station at Port Macleay, on
the other side.&nbsp; A small crowd of black children greeted us
on our landing, and then we climbed up into a commodious
waggonette drawn by two horses, and in a couple of hours had
reached the end of our journey.&nbsp; All the way neither house
nor road was to be seen.&nbsp; On our left was the lake, far
ahead was the Murray River, and on our right seemed to be a grand
park many miles in extent, only a little more parched-looking
than a park at home, and everywhere strewed with trees that had
fallen, which would have fetched a good price for firewood in the
towns if they could be got there.&nbsp; There were sheep by the
hundred, and there were horses roaming, as it were, monarchs of
all they surveyed.&nbsp; The scene was slightly monotonous.&nbsp;
Now and then we came to a rough fence, through the gates of which
we had to make our way, and I was not sorry when we dashed up to
a handsome residence on the brow of a hill commanding a fine view
of the lake.&nbsp; We had brought with us a respectable young
woman, who was to wait on us, and a good supply of eatables, so
that my fears on that important head were soon set at rest.&nbsp;
One does hear strange stories of life at a station.&nbsp; I heard
of a colonial governor who, meeting one of the original squatters
in the <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>enjoyment of all the luxury of a Melbourne Club, asked
him how, after that, he could put up with such lenten fare at
home.&nbsp; He replied to the effect that the governor was quite
mistaken&mdash;the squatters did live well; and, by way of
clinching his contention, he went on to state that he had
repeatedly seen at the same time on the table both sardines and
pickles!&nbsp; I think we had neither, but we lived as
luxuriously as in any gentleman&rsquo;s house either in the
colony or at home.&nbsp; We had the best of everything, and the
place was furnished in the most sumptuous manner, including even
a piano, which must have come a long way, and which could find
but little to do, as the house was only open when we were there,
and was again locked up as we drove away.&nbsp; Visitors are rare
in that part of the world; and as to the doctor, if his services
were required, the patient would have to wait a good while.&nbsp;
Death, or, what is more likely, recovery, might occur before the
doctor could arrive.&nbsp; There was little time to lose and
early in the morning Mr. Dooleete and his friend were driving in
a buggy across the plain to look at the horses.&nbsp; After I had
had my breakfast I toiled down in the sun to where the sheep were
penned in previous to being partially shorn.&nbsp; They had all
been driven in the night before, and the men&mdash;blacks, who
had come from <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>the missionary station, with their wives and little
ones&mdash;were lodged in tents on the shore of the lake.&nbsp;
They were stout and dull-looking, with wives, as a rule, still
stouter and duller-looking, with the exception of one young
woman&mdash;a very pretty half-breed.</p>
<p>A white man was the superintendent, and he had a dry and dusty
time of it as he did his duty&mdash;that is, divide the sheep,
the Merinos from the Leicesters, I believe.&nbsp; First, they had
to be driven into yards&mdash;and here the sheep-dogs were
specially serviceable&mdash;till they were all collected, to the
number, if I remember aright, of five or six thousand (of course,
they were not all in one pen); then they were driven along a
little lane, fenced in, where the superintendent stood at a
double gate, to divide the sheep according to their breed.&nbsp;
This was done by blocking one gate and opening the other side as
the sheep approached.&nbsp; Thus separated, they were taken, a
few at a time, into the shearing-shed, a large brick building,
with the sheep in the middle and the shearers on each side.&nbsp;
Operations were at once commenced.&nbsp; The shearer selects his
animal, holds it up between his legs, and quickly cuts off the
wool, which is swept off the stone floor by women, who separate
it and put it into sacks, while the frightened animal, released
from the grasp <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>of his persecutor, bounds through an opening in the
wall and rejoins his companions who have undergone a similar
process.&nbsp; It is warm work this, and every now and then the
workman stops to have a drink of water&mdash;a beverage
available, fortunately, to any amount.&nbsp; As soon as the sheep
are shorn, the wool is packed up and sent off to market.&nbsp; A
small steamer, which goes slowly up and down the lake, is thus
utilised for commercial purposes.&nbsp; I returned by that
steamer.&nbsp; It may be sure; it certainly is slow.&nbsp; Being
at this station was a vastly pleasant change to me.&nbsp; I had
had quite enough of city life.&nbsp; It may be very lonely to
live on that hill, in that fine house, with no neighbours with
whom to chat, far from shops and post-office and newspapers; but
with books and one&rsquo;s family it must be a noble
existence.&nbsp; There may be stormy winds out there, for I saw
many a fine tree blown down; but mostly the country round
rejoices in blue skies and an unclouded sun.&nbsp; In that region
there is no particular chance of overcrowding at any rate, just
at present.&nbsp; The worst of the squatter is that he does not
require much labour.&nbsp; A very few hands suffice for
him&mdash;except at the shearing season&mdash;to look after his
flocks and herds.&nbsp; You realize in such a place something of
the life of the Patriarchs, only considerably improved.&nbsp; The
owner of a station <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>must spend a good deal of his time in the saddle, and a
horse, I imagine, is infinitely to be preferred to the
camel.&nbsp; The noble steed enjoys himself as he springs along
the turf.&nbsp; At all times, whether lying down or rising up,
whether loaded or not, whether ungainly walking or hideously
trotting, a camel is a picture of bitter woefulness and abject
despair.&nbsp; The station, too, has its innocent
amusements.&nbsp; I have a friend who has a station about a
hundred miles from Melbourne.&nbsp; To him came when I was there
a city gentleman, who betted that he would kill a hundred snakes
within the hour, and he shot ninety-eight!&nbsp; A fond mother
who lives in a fine station in New South Wales, told me how once
upon a time she had to snatch away her little one sleeping on the
lawn, as a black snake had crept up to within a foot of its
precious head.&nbsp; Then there is a drought, and your flocks
have to be taken miles to water.&nbsp; After all, there is plenty
of excitement&mdash;for those who seek it&mdash;even in station
life.</p>
<h2><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE HEATHEN CHINEE.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">His Persecution&mdash;His Usefulness&mdash;His
Intellectual Ability.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Chinese in Australia have a
grievance.&nbsp; We have opened up China against the wishes of
their rulers, and when they take a leaf out of our book, and
commence opening up the world, we turn round and refuse them
admission.&nbsp; It is so in America, and it is so in
Australia.&nbsp; At every election meeting in Victoria when I was
there, the candidate had to declare that he was ready to vote for
the exclusion of the Chinese.&nbsp; This is how democracy uses
its power.&nbsp; The Chinaman is civil, and obliging, and
hard-working; besides, he is sober; but the Australians
won&rsquo;t have him at any price, and raise the cry of Australia
for the Australians, which means that no poor English emigrant
may go there to take lower wages than his <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>mates
rather than starve at home.&nbsp; As each colony is isolated,
this will mean in time that the work of each colony is to be done
only by its own workmen.&nbsp; Already in Queensland I see that a
complaint has been made because some workmen from Sydney have
been brought in to work.&nbsp; Australia wants opening up.&nbsp;
It has only a sparse population on its borders, and in many parts
the workman, who is master of the situation, will not work
himself, nor allow any one else to do so.&nbsp; The general
public suffer, but that is their look-out.&nbsp; Prices are kept
up by Protection, and the protected further protect themselves by
keeping out the labourer anxious to earn an honest living.&nbsp;
As the Chinese are weak and friendless, it is against them
chiefly that this policy is enforced.&nbsp; I heard one day of a
sturdy workman who had applied for relief.&nbsp; When asked what
he had been doing of late, he replied that he had been picking
grapes.&nbsp; Questioned why he had given the occupation up, he
answered that he was working with Chinese, and the boss expected
him to work as hard as they did.</p>
<p>Australia wants to compete with the cheap wine-sellers of
Bordeaux; but she is sadly handicapped in this and other
ways.&nbsp; The farmer finds his corn-fields eaten up by the
parroquets, because he can hire no cheap labour to scare away the
birds.&nbsp; In the big <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>towns it is the Chinaman who
supplies the people with cheap fish and vegetables.&nbsp; I own
to a liking for the &lsquo;heathen Chinee.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said a well-known London Democrat to me after I
had returned home, &lsquo;I see what you want.&nbsp; You want to
reduce the British workman to the level of the heathen
Chinee.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; was my reply.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I want to bring the British workman up to the level of the
heathen Chinee.&nbsp; He is economical, industrious, sober, and
always civil, and one cannot say that in all cases of the British
workman.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in the northern district they are sadly
wanted.&nbsp; While in Adelaide, I read a letter in <i>The South
Australian Register</i>, in which the writer emphatically
declares that if any development of the northern territory is to
take place, it must be by the Chinese, or not at all.&nbsp; The
writer remarks: &lsquo;If the Chinese are excluded or kept out
here, all development will cease, and the northern territory will
just resolve itself into a great Government camp, where some will
be employed to watch the telegraph wires, while others are
scraping the rust off the wheels of the railway
carriages.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he goes on to speak of the bogus
telegrams and Munchausen reports that caused the Chinese
scare.&nbsp; This northern territory, be it remembered, which has
been tacked on to South Australia and governed from Adelaide,
embraces an immense extent of country, <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>and
contains an area of about 323,620 square miles.&nbsp; Its
principal harbour is Port Darwin, which is one of the finest in
Australia, almost equalling that of Sydney.&nbsp; It is rich in
mineral resources, and gold and rubies.&nbsp; The climate is
tropical, and the soil in many parts is very rich.&nbsp; Already
it contains many great cattle stations.&nbsp; The writer I have
referred to says: &lsquo;I have had a nearly three years&rsquo;
residence here, trying to develop a large run for a Victorian
owner.&nbsp; This enables me to speak with complete knowledge of
the climate, and the kind of labour suitable for the country; for
out-of-door work the European may be dismissed at
once.&rsquo;&nbsp; Clearly, in such a case, the Chinaman is the
right man in the right place.&nbsp; But &lsquo;No,&rsquo; say the
Queenslanders; &lsquo;if you allow the Chinese there, they will
cross the border and come to us.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, says an
intelligent Adelaide editor to me: &lsquo;It cannot be; the
Chinese are many, we are few&mdash;they will take possession of
all Australia.&rsquo;&nbsp; Surely it would not be a difficult
thing to limit the extent of Chinese immigration.&nbsp; A
Chinaman cannot disguise his nationality.&nbsp; Dress him in
Christian clothes&mdash;his <i>tout ensemble</i>, his oval face,
his brown skin, his high cheek-bones, his little twinkling eyes,
will betray him, to say nothing of his pigtail and his pigeon
English.&nbsp; By all means, in the interests of <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>civilization, I would say, let him come.&nbsp; It would
be better for Australia and the world that it should be opened
up, than allowed to remain a waste.</p>
<p>In Adelaide I have seen a splendid specimen of what a Chinaman
may become when he is naturalized and turned into a British
subject.&nbsp; His name is Mr. Way Lee, and a more agreeable man
I have not seen for a long time.&nbsp; His shop was full of China
ware and Chinese tea.&nbsp; He had on a black coat, a white
waistcoat, a light pair of trousers, and his pigtail was rolled
into a neat plait at the back of his head.&nbsp; In his
drawing-room he had a piano, and a portrait of her Majesty in a
very rich gold frame.&nbsp; His only peculiarity of costume was
as regards his small feet, which were encased in Chinese
slippers.&nbsp; He offered me a glass of wine much as an ordinary
Christian would have done; I refused it, but, however, accepted a
Manilla cheroot, and we got into a pleasant talk.&nbsp; He told
me that he was thirty-seven; I should have guessed that he was
not more than twenty-five.&nbsp; He had two extraordinary,
highly-coloured religious Chinese pictures, which made me believe
that he was a follower of Confucius.&nbsp; However, I was
deceived.&nbsp; &lsquo;I go,&rsquo; said he, with a bland smile,
&lsquo;to the Baptist, the Congregational, the Wesleyan
Churches&mdash;any vere my friends take me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Not a
bigot, at any rate, is Mr. Way Lee.&nbsp; In Adelaide he has won
golden opinions.&nbsp; He has traded there for years; is
straightforward in all his doings; has deservedly gained the
reputation of being an exemplary citizen&mdash;strict in his
regard for municipal rights and regulations, and vigilant in his
endeavours to enforce the maintenance of law and order.&nbsp; And
his own Government have conferred upon him the dignity of a
Mandarin.&nbsp; He is renowned for his charity.&nbsp; Well, he
has succeeded in business, and has an establishment in Sydney
which, naturally, he desires to visit, but by crossing the border
into New South Wales he renders himself liable to a heavy fine of
&pound;100.&nbsp; He has written to Sir Henry Parkes on the
subject, but the Free Trade Premier tells him he cannot help
him.&nbsp; Why, asks the paper which has taken, and rightly
taken, up his case, should Mr. Way Lee, who has established as
strong a claim upon the goodwill of his fellows, and the
protection of the State as any of his trade competitors, be
placed at a serious disadvantage in carrying on his business,
because he happens to have been born in the Flowery Land?&nbsp;
Why should he be held up to the ridicule and scorn of his fellow
colonists because he hails from China?&nbsp; The time will come
when Australia will be heartily ashamed of conduct which savours
more <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>of
the narrow and intolerant spirit of the dark ages than of the
enlightenment and liberality of modern times.&nbsp; There are not
many such decent Chinese in Australia.&nbsp; Whose fault is
that?&nbsp; Certainly the Caucasian has set the heathen Chinee a
very sorry example.&nbsp; &lsquo;Government have
inspectors,&rsquo; said Way Lee to me; &lsquo;Government can put
them down if they gamble and be wicked.&rsquo;&nbsp; Surely the
Caucasian can take care of himself; at any rate, he has the
credit of being able to do so.&nbsp; The little almond-eyed
heathen cheats him when he is drunk; then let him keep
sober.&nbsp; I have been in an opium den; I have been in a
gin-palace.&nbsp; The opium den is a heaven compared with the
latter.&nbsp; In Australia every drunken larrikin thinks it good
fun to push down or ill-treat a Chinee.&nbsp; Such brutality
makes one&rsquo;s blood boil.&nbsp; Nor can it be well with a
people where such ruffianism exists in its midst.&nbsp; Australia
is big, and so big that the Australians themselves are little
acquainted with it.&nbsp; Surely there is room enough for the
Chinaman, and he can open up such parts of it as are unhealthy
for the European.&nbsp; Mr. Way Lee, in every respect, is as good
an Australian as any I have met with; his manners are
unexceptionable; he goes into society.&nbsp; Such as he do not
level down, but are levelled up, and Australia might do with
China a large and profitable trade.&nbsp; I <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>question
whether the leaders in the anti-Chinese crusade are really in
earnest; they join in it as a means to an end; by means of it
they trust to get place and power.&nbsp; All I could do was to
assure Mr. Lee that we in England were not responsible for such
treatment as he had received; that we had little else to do than
to supply the colonies with governors and a fleet.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, I know,&rsquo; he said; but he felt the hardship,
nevertheless.</p>
<p>Intellectually the heathen Chinee is coming to the
front.&nbsp; In describing the results of recent examinations at
the University of Melbourne, a newspaper writer says: &lsquo;Dr.
Bevan&rsquo;s eldest son (Willett) carried off no less than nine
prizes at the Church of England Grammar School, including the Dux
and Speaker&rsquo;s Prize, another son of the doctor&rsquo;s also
doing well.&nbsp; It is not without satirical suggestion,
however, that Cheong (who was second Dux) beat Bevan in English
spelling and New Testament Greek.&nbsp; It is curious, to say the
least of it, that a Chinese should excel an English boy in
<i>English</i> spelling, and that the son of a convert from
heathenism should surpass the son of a Christian pastor in an
examination upon the textbook of the Christian faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As to the usefulness of the Chinee in Australia I am glad to
supplement my remarks with an extract <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>from a letter of a gentleman in the
<i>London and China Express</i>.</p>
<p>The writer, Mr. Sampson, an intelligent resident of many years
in China, says: &lsquo;During a recent visit to Victoria, during
which I made it my particular business to inquire into matters
connected with the Chinese, I found that the objection to Chinese
immigration is by no means universal in that colony.&nbsp; The
principal objectors are the labour-aristocracy and the
politicians who seek to gain their votes; on the other side are
the employers of labour generally&mdash;farmers, fruit-growers,
masters of steamers, women burdened with domestic cares, and
sometimes even diggers and unskilled labourers, who are not bound
to accept the doctrines dictated by a labour union.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want the Chinese to go,&rdquo; said a
labouring man to me, at a wayside inn, some ten miles from
Sandhurst; he was an Irishman, and was celebrating the news of
the defeat of the <i>Times</i> in the matter of the forged
letters.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want the Chinese to go; we
want them to stop here, and grow cabbages for us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This pithily-expressed view of the question I found very
prevalent.&nbsp; A lady fellow-passenger in a steamer said to me,
with a sigh, &ldquo;Ah, if women had votes there would be no
restrictions on the immigration of Chinese.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
valued them as <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>faithful and dutiful domestic servants, and as polite,
obliging, and honest hawkers of vegetables and other small
household requirements.&nbsp; I visited a large orchard in which
every grape had been sucked dry by birds, and the parrots were
making sad havoc amongst the apples, pears, and peaches.&nbsp; I
remarked to the owner that in China a couple of men could be
employed to keep away the birds at ten shillings a month.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I should have
to pay eight shillings a day, and then I should have to stay on
the grounds myself to see that they did their work.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The following characteristic story was told me: An Australian,
being about to leave the colony for a year or two, instructed a
broker to let for that period a piece of land which he
owned.&nbsp; The broker secured a tenant, and the owner agreed to
the terms without inquiring who the tenant was.&nbsp; When the
time arrived for him to sign the legal documents he found that
the proposed tenant was a Chinaman.&nbsp; &lsquo;He wished to
repudiate the bargain, but matters had advanced too far for him
to do so.&nbsp; On his return from England he found that the
Chinese tenant had improved the ground so much that he said,
&ldquo;If ever I have to go away again I will let a Chinaman have
the use of my land <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>for nothing rather than accept rent from a white
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; These anecdotes are, of course, only isolated
cases, but they serve to illustrate opinions, and to show forth
facts of importance.&rsquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE LARRIKIN IN AUSTRALIA.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">What the Larrikin is&mdash;A Social, Moral,
and Political Danger&mdash;A Natural Foe of the Chinaman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, so the story
runs, an old gentleman was walking along the streets of London,
when he was accosted by a little boy, who asked him for a light
for his cigarette.&nbsp; The old gentleman, of course, was
shocked, and indignantly remarked that when he was young little
boys were not allowed to smoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; replied
the lad, &lsquo;there ain&rsquo;t any boys now; they are all
young men; that&rsquo;s what we call &rsquo;em, and old men we
call thundering fools.&rsquo;&nbsp; This feeling, unfortunately,
exists wherever there are civilized men and women.&nbsp; In
savage countries it may be that the hoary head is a crown of
honour; but where the schoolmaster has gone abroad the first
impression made on the mind of the favoured scholar is that he is
a man and his <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>father but a fool.&nbsp; Old customs, old traditions,
somewhat interfere with this idea in English towns and villages,
yet the increasing tendency of the age is in another
direction.&nbsp; All kindly correction has been denied the youth,
especially of the working-classes.&nbsp; Let the lad ever so
richly deserve a flogging, father or mother threatens &lsquo;if
you dare to lay a hand upon my boy,&rsquo; and so the master
spares the rod and spoils the child.&nbsp; In some quarters the
boy soon begins to earn his living, and then he spends his wages
and his time in bad company, and is a terror to father and
mother, and master, and all with whom he has to do.&nbsp; It is
to this phase of civilization is due, in that highly-favoured
country of Australia, the existence of the larrikin.&nbsp; It was
while I was out there that there died the policeman who invented
the name.&nbsp; In the course of his arduous duties he had to
catch and bring before the magistrates a group of troublesome
lads.&nbsp; &lsquo;What were they doing?&rsquo; asked the
magistrates.&nbsp; &lsquo;I caught them a-larrikin,&rsquo; was
the reply, and ever since then the name of larrikin denotes a lad
in a hobbledehoy state, who is a torment to himself and everyone
around.&nbsp; Worst of all, the chances are that he develops into
a rough, and brutal, and unmannerly man.&nbsp; As it is, he is a
nuisance everywhere, but a special danger in Australia in a
social, and moral, <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>and political point of view.&nbsp; In a new country
naturally the young people assert themselves more than in an old
one.&nbsp; You see this in America as well as in Australia, but
in the latter country the press does its duty and points out the
danger.&nbsp; In one of the best of the Australian
papers&mdash;<i>The South Australian Register</i>&mdash;a
leader-writer, in recommending the volunteer movement, remarks
that there is no hardship in asking the Australian young man to
take his place among the defenders of his country.&nbsp; On the
contrary it would be of great physical and moral benefit to him
to undergo the training of a citizen soldier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Impatience of control, lack of discipline, a contempt for
authority, the absence of a sense of duty&mdash;these are the
prevailing faults of the youth of the day, and it is certain that
a course of military exercises would have a bracing effect upon
the moral nature, helping to make the young men better sons,
better husbands, better fathers&mdash;in every way better
qualified to discharge the important functions of responsible
citizens in a State where all possess equal political rights and
perfect freedom of action.&rsquo;&nbsp; As I write I read in a
New South Wales paper: &lsquo;Larrikinism is on the increase in
the suburbs of Brisbane.&nbsp; Constant complaints are made of
insults to pedestrians, drunken quarrels and profane
language.&nbsp; On Sunday the <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>hotels a short distance from the
city are visited, and under the influence of the potations
indulged in the most unholy scenes of rioting and revelling take
place on the roads.&nbsp; Church-goers are subjected to
insult.&nbsp; Decent parents are obliged to shut their children
within doors to prevent their ears being assailed by the oaths
and curses freely uttered by these lawless pests.&nbsp; The
police generally are nowhere to be seen, and when present are
indisposed to arrest the offenders.&nbsp; Our laws are badly
applied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The larrikin is the natural foe of the heathen Chinee; not
that he dislikes his imputed vices, but his real virtues.&nbsp; A
friend of mine was walking near the suburbs of Melbourne, and he
came across a Chinaman working in his garden, where only parsley
was growing.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is this?&rsquo; said my
friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you grow vegetables and
flowers?&nbsp; I should have thought they would have paid you
better.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, sir,&rsquo; replied the heathen,
&lsquo;if I were to grow vegetables and flowers, the larrikins
would come and pull them all up; so I can only grow
parsley.&rsquo;&nbsp; And thus the people of Melbourne suffer,
for those of them who have no gardens of their own have to depend
for their supplies on the ever civil and industrious
Chinamen.&nbsp; Since I have returned home, I see a Melbourne
judge declared that it was unsafe to <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>walk the streets of Melbourne by
night or by day, and that that is so is, I take it, mainly due to
the larrikins, who exist in such numbers as to defy the power of
the police.&nbsp; When a larrikin gets drunk and quarrelsome he
naturally goes in for the Chinese; they are few, and he and his
friends are many.&nbsp; They are fond of fighting, and a Chinaman
is a man of peace.&nbsp; It is fine sport for the larrikin to
trample down and devastate the well-kept garden of the heathen
Chinee, to get into his little shop and spoil his goods, to knock
about and ill-treat the son of the Celestial Empire; nor does he
object to murder one if he has the chance, as probably by means
of perjury and hard swearing he will be able to escape the
punishment due to his crime.&nbsp; By night the larrikins sleep
in the parks, which are the glory of all the Australian cities,
and the scenes there, so I was informed, are disgraceful.&nbsp;
It is not safe for a respectable person to walk across the parks
alone of a night.&nbsp; As in London, almost all respectable
people live out of town, and they have but a faint idea of what
goes on in their absence.&nbsp; The climate allows anyone, at any
rate during the summer months, to sleep in the open air, and the
rascals of the community for the time being may each one say for
himself:</p>
<p class="gutsumm">&lsquo;I am monarch of all I survey,<br />
My right there is none to dispute.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>It is
one of the drawbacks of the Australian climate that it gives the
larrikin a chance such as he has nowhere else.&nbsp; Walking one
evening with a friend in one of the parks which adorn Adelaide,
we came to a young tree which had the bark cut off in a circle
round the trunk&mdash;in other words, it was ring-barked.&nbsp;
My friend indignantly exclaimed: &lsquo;See what the larrikins
have been up to!&rsquo;&nbsp; That tree was doomed to die.&nbsp;
It was a valuable one.&nbsp; It had been planted for a special
purpose&mdash;to add to the attractions of the park, and to be,
when fully grown, a benefit to the entire community.&nbsp; It had
leaves on.&nbsp; It did not seem to have suffered much damage;
but it was doomed to die, nevertheless.&nbsp; As a resident in
Adelaide, my friend was very much provoked at the sight; and no
wonder.</p>
<p>Wherever you go you meet the detestable larrikin, but it is in
Melbourne that he chiefly abounds.&nbsp; Fathers and mothers are
much to be blamed on his account.&nbsp; There is an old
commandment about honouring thy father and mother, to which, if I
were a Melbourne parson, I should devote many sermons; but, alas!
in a young community, with many questionable emigrants, where the
fever of gold-getting in any way rages fiercely, it is not always
that a young man can honour his father and mother.&nbsp; At any
rate, the <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>evil exists, and Church and State between them will
have hard work to put it down.&nbsp; The larrikin delights in
mischief for mischief&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He is not necessarily
very poor or wretched.&nbsp; Perhaps he gets too much flesh meat,
and a vegetarian diet would suit him better.&nbsp; Dr. Dale tells
us a good deal of the high spirits of the Australian
youth&mdash;a phase of Australian life which did not strike me at
all.&nbsp; Was he thinking of the Australian larrikin?&nbsp; Such
high spirits are not to my taste.&nbsp; In one respect the
larrikin reminds one of the days of Tom and Jerry as depicted in
the vivid caricatures of the late George Cruikshank, but Tom and
Jerry were gentlemen, and that makes a great difference.&nbsp;
Rather I should take him to be a son of Belial, and thus give him
a more ancient origin.&nbsp; His delight is to join himself to a
gang of twenty or thirty to break street lamps, to wrench off
knockers, tear down fences, mob and maltreat policemen, hustle
respectable people at all hours by day and by night, and to
assault some poor pedestrian, especially when a little the worse
for liquor, and rob him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Scarce a week
passes,&rsquo; says a writer in the Colonies, &lsquo;without some
larrikin outbreak.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was even with difficulty that
I could steer clear of him at times.&nbsp; I fear we have too
much of the larrikin at home, but that is no reason why he should
be allowed <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>to taint the virgin soil of a new world.&nbsp; Our
colonies ought to be an improvement on the old country.&nbsp;
What is wrong at home they should avoid.&nbsp; Let them imitate
our virtues.&nbsp; On a new soil they have a better chance.</p>

192</span>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN AN AUSTRALIAN VINEYARD.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Fruit Supply&mdash;Tintarra Wine&mdash;Mr.
Thomas Hardy&mdash;The Temperance Question.</p>
<p>One of the charms of South Australia is the fruit, which, in
the shape of grapes, and pears, and peaches, and apples, you see
everywhere displayed, and at astonishingly low prices.&nbsp;
Grapes are sold at five pounds for sixpence in the retail shops,
and I have seen magnificent grapes three pounds for sixpence,
which in London would be held cheap at half-a-crown.&nbsp; If the
colony is ever to be very rich, its fruit trade will be no
inconsiderable factor in the consummation so devoutly to be
wished.&nbsp; The farmer and the squatter have to contend with
difficulties which often end in bankruptcy, owing to the terrible
droughts common in this part of the world.&nbsp; But if the
merchants of Adelaide will send us their spare fruit, we in
London <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>can take any amount and at very remunerative
prices.&nbsp; I saw during my tour the vineyards of Mr. Thomas
Hardy, within a short distance of Adelaide, and I must own that
the place is well worth a visit.&nbsp; Though of small extent
(the area is only 60 acres), Bankside, as the vineyard is called,
yields a more varied produce, and furnishes a better illustration
of the capabilities of the soil and climate of the district in
which it is situated, than any other estate in Australia.&nbsp;
Mr. Hardy is a fine specimen of a horticulturist, and well
deserves the splendid silver trophy which ornaments his
drawing-room&mdash;and of which he is justly proud&mdash;given
him as one who has done more than anyone in the colony to develop
its resources.&nbsp; He has made good use of his grapes.&nbsp; We
are not all teetotalers, and he grows more grapes on his various
estates than the Australians can eat, whether as grapes for
dessert, or in the shape of raisins and currants.&nbsp; With the
rest he makes wine.&nbsp; He is proud of his wine&mdash;proud of
the fact that even at Bordeaux, in the heart of the enemy&rsquo;s
country, as it were, he won a gold medal for its excellence;
proud of the fact that his celebrated Tintara wine has found a
good place in the London market.&nbsp; As I have seen it
manufactured I can testify as to its purity.&nbsp; He was sending
this year 45,000 gallons to London.&nbsp; He would prefer to keep
it <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>longer in his cellars, but the Londoners want it, and
he cannot keep them waiting.&nbsp; Why not sell the original
grapes? asks the teetotaler.&nbsp; I reply, He grows more grapes
than the community can devour with a decent regard to its health,
and as people exist who are mistaken enough to think Paul was
right when he recommended Timothy a little wine for his
stomach&rsquo;s sake and his often infirmities, Mr. Hardy thinks
he is a public benefactor if he supplies the public with a
genuine wine, the produce of the grape and of the grape
alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Hardy is no ignoramus; he is a much-travelled man, and has
studied the vineyards of France and Spain and California.&nbsp;
In his establishment he uses the best machinery&mdash;which of
course is French&mdash;for the distillation of the purest and
strongest spirits of wine, to which purpose such grapes are
devoted as are not good enough for the production of wine of the
best quality.&nbsp; As to the manufacture of wine, that is a very
simple affair.&nbsp; The grapes are picked and placed in carts,
and carried to the mill, where they lie fermenting in a mass; the
juice is then pressed off into slate vats, a brown and by no
means attractive-looking fluid.&nbsp; The red wines take longer
to ferment, as the outside skin contains the colouring
matter.&nbsp; In the case of the white grapes, the stalks are cut
away <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>by
a machine invented for the purpose, otherwise the astringency of
the wine would be too great.&nbsp; After a time the juice is put
into casks, where it lies stored in cool and capacious cellars
till it is required by the outside public.&nbsp; In some of the
casks I saw the wine had been kept ten or twelve years.&nbsp;
Last year Mr. Hardy made in this way 160,000 gallons of
wine.&nbsp; He began life as a gold-digger.&nbsp; He commenced
growing grapes for wine in 1853, and has been at it ever
since.&nbsp; Another charming vineyard is that of Sir Samuel
Davenport, to which Thomas Binney, when in Australia, was always
ready to retreat.&nbsp; It is very interesting, this original
vineyard of Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Since 1853 he has purchased
several vineyards in various districts, the most important one
being Tintara, about 25 miles to the South of Adelaide, where he
has 150 acres under vines.&nbsp; It is in the town cellars that
most of the blending is accomplished.&nbsp; A good deal of wine
is bottled off at Bankside, but the main bulk of the generous
fluid, to be poetical, is carted away in casks, on waggons which
are as un-romantic as the horses which draw them or the men who
drive.&nbsp; There is little of the picturesque in the
manufacture of Australian wine.</p>
<p>But as to the grounds, no words can describe their
exuberance.&nbsp; Some of the pears Mr. Hardy exhibited <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>at the
London Exhibition weighed three pounds each, and were afterwards,
I believe, eaten by Royalty.&nbsp; The Bankside property consists
of a very deep chocolate soil, resting on a strong clay.&nbsp;
Irrigation is easily practised over this small area.&nbsp; Water
is raised from the bed of the Torrens River to the top of the
bank, and, that being higher than the surrounding country, is
easily distributed.&nbsp; It is curious what good a little water
can accomplish.&nbsp; In one part the ground rises, and as water
will not run uphill&mdash;at any rate, in Australia&mdash;the
trees have to do without, and it is astonishing to note the
difference between the trees and the fruit they bear, compared
with the others, although but a few feet from each other.&nbsp;
Everywhere around me were oranges ripening for the home
market.&nbsp; &lsquo;An acre of oranges is a fortune, is it
not?&rsquo; I asked, with my head full of what I had read.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; replied Mr. Hardy, with a smile, &lsquo;those
books are written by men who have land to sell.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
we came to the lemons.&nbsp; What a wonderful plant is the lemon
tree!&nbsp; You may see the ripe fruit growing side-by-side with
the blossom.&nbsp; It is productive all the year round,
like&mdash;I will not say whose; let the reader fill up the
blank&mdash;like Mr. &mdash;&rsquo;s great mind.&nbsp; As to the
quinces, I never saw anything like them, and though I intimated
that in <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>England we did not make much of them, Mr. Hardy assured
me that in his opinion quince jam was the finest in the
world.&nbsp; The citrons, however, were still finer than the
quinces.&nbsp; We had also quite a show of olives; they grow in
rows, and, like the almonds on the estate, they are made to do
duty as fencing-posts.&nbsp; A vine in the open air over the
house attracted my notice; it had spread over a surface of many
yards, and was a good illustration of what may be done on
Australian soil.&nbsp; Surely every Australian ought to grow his
own grapes; and then as to making them into raisins and currants,
nothing seems easier under such a sun.&nbsp; The grapes at
Bankside are gathered and laid on boards to dry.&nbsp; Those for
raisins for the table are laid on gravel&mdash;a custom Mr. Hardy
borrowed from the Spaniards.&nbsp; It is not found necessary to
turn them, the under grapes drying as well as the top ones, from
the heat of the gravel floor.&nbsp; The turning of grapes into
raisins is a more complicated process than merely growing them
for the market.&nbsp; The bunches of ripe fruit are placed in
oblong sieves and plunged for twenty seconds into a tank of
boiling lye made from ashes, which are got from the vine
prunings.&nbsp; The dipping takes the bloom off the fruit, but
causes it to dry in one-third the time it would otherwise
take.&nbsp; They are then <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>spread evenly on wooden trays and
exposed to the sun.&nbsp; When the grapes are about three-parts
dried, they are removed to kilns, heated with hot-air pipes, and
the drying is completed in from twelve to twenty-four hours, when
they are taken out and rubbed partly free of most of the
stalks.&nbsp; The next process is to run them through a winnowing
machine which still further strips them of their stalk.&nbsp;
They are then packed up in boxes by girls and pressed with a
handy screw-press, six at a time.&nbsp; Currants are treated in a
similar manner, minus the dipping.&nbsp; The raisins intended for
the table, I may mention, are also not dipped, as that would
spoil their appearance by removing the bloom.&nbsp; In the
grounds a good many sultanas are also grown; quite equal to the
fruit imported.&nbsp; Altogether, at Bankside, they turn out
about twenty tons of dried fruit every year.</p>
<p>Australia, Mr. Hardy anticipates, will be able to equal the
best wine districts in the world.&nbsp; A similar remark may
apply to its almonds and raisins and currants.&nbsp; Adelaide
rejoices in a trade which bids fair to become greater every
year.&nbsp; As the Select Committee upon Vegetable Produce
reported at the end of 1887: &lsquo;If the whole area of our
colony now devoted to the growth of wheat were one vast vineyard,
the yield would not be equal to the deficiency <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>in the wine
production of France through the devastation of the
phylloxera.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hence South Australia, to the disgust of
Dr. Hannay, calculates much on her growing wine trade.&nbsp;
Statistics furnished by Mr. Hayter, the Government Statist of
Victoria, give evidence of the way in which wine in South
Australia is superseding the consumption of spirits.&nbsp; This
may account for the sobriety which seems to characterise South
Australia as compared with the rest of the colonies.&nbsp;
Altogether, Adelaide may claim to be the fairest city of
Australia, and to contain the kindest and best-mannered
people&mdash;so far as they may be judged by the passing stranger
at their gates, and if I was in search of an ideal life I should
say it would be that of one who sits under his own vine and
fig-tree, as the South Australian grape-grower does.</p>
<p>While writing of wine, it may be as well to sum up here what I
have to say on intemperance in Australia.&nbsp; No little
excitement was produced in Adelaide when the writer was there by
a telegraphic report of a speech by Dr. Hannay on his return from
Australia, as to the amount of drinking in Adelaide, certainly
the most sober of all the prosperous cities on the Australian
Continent.&nbsp; As usual, the telegraphic report was wrong, and
<a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Dr.
Hannay assures me that what he did say was that he regretted to
find that so many gentlemen in Adelaide looked to the increase of
the Australian wine trade as a source of colonial revenue and
colonial prosperity.&nbsp; As a devoted temperance reformer, it
is clear Dr. Hannay could not have said less.&nbsp; It was an
opinion which he was quite at liberty to utter, and with which no
one could find fault.&nbsp; Had the telegraphic abridgment been
correct, he would certainly have been to blame, as, undoubtedly,
Adelaide is a sober city&mdash;that is, sober as compared with
Sydney and Melbourne.&nbsp; In the older cities there are yet
traces of the times when, as during the madness created by the
discovery of alluvial gold, miners, who in England had been
content with beer and porter, would drink twenty pounds&rsquo;
worth of champagne at a sitting, pouring it all into a pail, and
asking every passer-by to have a drink; but that awful time of
extravagance is past; however, the taint of it remains, and there
is still a startling amount of drunkenness, especially among that
part of the population who can least afford it&mdash;the
wage-earning class, who, in Australia, if they are sober and
industrious, have advantages in the way of investment which
assuredly they lack at home.&nbsp; Workmen as a rule are paid
high wages, and, when they receive a large amount at a <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>time, as
they often do, do not know what to do with it.&nbsp; In too many
cases, in the interior more especially, they still adhere to the
custom of knocking a cheque down, as they call it.&nbsp; The
workman repairs to the nearest public-house, gives his cheque
into the publican&rsquo;s hands, and then begins a drunken orgie
in which everyone is asked to join, till the landlord tells him
his money is all gone, gives him a bottle of rum, and then kicks
him out of the house, often to perish by the road-side, thus once
more illustrating the old remark, &lsquo;that the tender mercies
of the wicked are very cruel.&rsquo;&nbsp; One publican is said
to have made &pound;40,000 a year at one time in this way.&nbsp;
The temperance reformers in Australia have, it is very evident, a
wide field of usefulness before them.&nbsp; Many of the
Australians spend enormous sums of money in drink.&nbsp; I
travelled with an Australian, who seemed to me never what is
vulgarly called the worse for liquor, yet whose weekly bill on
board the steamer amounted to between four and five pounds, a sum
of money which assuredly might have been better employed.&nbsp;
In one respect Australia sets us a good example.&nbsp; It has
taken to building temperance coffee hotels, or palaces, as they
term them, on the grandest scale.&nbsp; As the meals are all
served up without intoxicating drinks, these places must have a
good effect, <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>as the guest, however fond of drink he may be, is
compelled for the time to be an abstainer.&nbsp; Adelaide
unfortunately has no good temperance hotels worthy of the
name.</p>
<p>It is a great question in Australia as to which is the finer
city&mdash;Melbourne or Sydney&mdash;and the inhabitants of each
are wonderfully jealous of each other.&nbsp; You offend a
Melbourne man if you have anything to say in favour of Sydney,
and at the latter city you hear little in favour of
Melbourne.&nbsp; Both cities show too many public-houses, and
both cities contain far too many drunkards; but in Sydney they
are an especial nuisance, as every house has, as a rule, two
rooms on each side the principal entrance which are used as bars,
and which all day long, very much to the annoyance of the
traveller, who is compelled to use them, are filled by a
disreputable crowd, boozing from morning till night.&nbsp; It is
the same as regards the theatre&mdash;the bar is as conspicuous,
and quite as well filled, as the theatre itself.&nbsp; In many
cases the bar is hired and carried on as a separate speculation,
independently of the hotel proprietor.&nbsp; Two or three showy
barmaids are engaged, a screen is put before the door to shield
it from public gaze, and inside there is a license of which few
people have an idea.&nbsp; The girls sell the drink, and they
drink themselves.&nbsp; <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>As the evening advances the hilarity
is of a somewhat boisterous character.&nbsp; Now and then a girl
comes from behind the bar and waltzes round the room with some
admirer&mdash;while she leers over his shoulder at another.&nbsp;
The utmost freedom is permitted, and hundreds of idiots thus
waste their time and spend their money, and injure their health,
and learn how easy and how pleasant is the road to
destruction.&nbsp; Fortunately, the bars are closed at eleven,
and they are shut up on a Sunday, or they would be a great deal
more mischievous than they really are; but the mischief they do
is very great.&nbsp; In Australia the population is of an
exceedingly shifting character; men are always on the move from
one place to another, and of an evening, as they are strangers in
the city and have no friends, and time hangs heavy on their
hands, they have recourse to the nearest bar.&nbsp; It is there
the sharper always takes his victim.&nbsp; In every case, and I
heard of several, in which inexperienced travellers had been
fleeced, I always found that the dupe had first been taken to the
bar and treated to a drink.&nbsp; As I came back I fell in with a
poor steerage passenger who had been done out of &pound;20, a sum
he could ill afford to lose, by a repetition of the confidence
trick.&nbsp; He made the acquaintance of the sharper by means of
the latter offering him a drink.&nbsp; <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>Hundreds
and thousands of pounds have been lost in this way.&nbsp; There
is no place so dangerous to a &lsquo;new chum,&rsquo; as the
emigrant to Australia is called, as the bar of a
public-house.&nbsp; Alas! in Sydney these pitfalls are on every
side; I think that there is only one hotel in the town without
its bar.</p>
<p>It was the old custom to sell lots of land by auction at which
a good deal of wine was drunk, under the excitement produced by
which many a purchaser bought his whistle at a dearer
price.&nbsp; &lsquo;If such lunches cost &pound;40,&rsquo; writes
one of the oldest of the Melbourne colonists, Mr. Westgarth,
&lsquo;which was given to me as a moderate average, who suffered?
argued their justifiers; the exhilaration they produced gave
&pound;400 more to the net proceeds.&rsquo;&nbsp; The brisk
liquor appreciably blew up the prices, as the same lots, cut up
and rearranged, would come again and yet again under the hammer;
and no doubt many a poor speculator burnt his fingers in that
way, especially when we remember how at one time there came such
a wonderful depreciation of property in what its admirers still
love to term &lsquo;Marvellous Melbourne.&rsquo;&nbsp; It may be
that there is less drinking now, and that people go to business
and to sales with less muddled brains.&nbsp; But no one can walk
in the shipping quarter of Melbourne on a Saturday afternoon, or
stop at a Sydney hotel <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>for a day or two, without feeling
that in either town there is vast room for improvement in the
matter of drink.&nbsp; In both places there is a fearful amount
of gambling and betting and wild speculation, and undoubtedly a
good deal of that goes on under the influence of the drink.&nbsp;
Many of the suicides which, as I told the people of Adelaide,
were such a matter of wonderment to me, are to be attributed to
drink, or the depression caused by it when the excitement is
over, and the poor shattered drinker is, indeed, a cup too low
and quite unable in his dazed condition to face the stern
realities of life.&nbsp; Travelling one day from Brisbane to
Sydney, the writer met a gentleman, of whom he asked if Mr. Blank
was known to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, well,&rsquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;he committed
suicide only a little while ago; and the Western Australian
papers are full of the details.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was no need to say any more.&nbsp; The poor fellow had
gone out as an emigrant.&nbsp; At home he had been in the habit
of drinking to excess, and in Australia the loneliness and
difficulty of his life was too much for him; he drank to excess,
and then took away with his own rash hand his blighted
life.&nbsp; In Australia the number of such blighted lives
through drink is far too plentiful.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">AN AUSTRALIAN MILLIONAIRE.</span><br />
Mr. James Tyson.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I was seated in the
dining-saloon of the <i>Orizaba</i>, an Australian, pointing to a
particular table, remarked to me that there were three
millionaires dining there.&nbsp; I am no company for such.&nbsp;
They are out of my sphere.&nbsp; However, one of them kindly
invited me to dine with him in Melbourne.&nbsp; I would like to
have accepted the invitation.&nbsp; Alas! I was engaged to dine
elsewhere.&nbsp; One would like to dine with a millionaire.&nbsp;
Tom Hood evidently did, or he would not have told how</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The company ate and drank from gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They revelled, they sang, and were merry;<br />
And one of the gold sticks rose from his chair,<br />
And toasted the &ldquo;Lass with the golden hair,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a bumper of golden sherry.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to popular report, the great millionaires <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>of
Australia are Mr. James Tyson, six millions; Sir William Clarke,
three; and Mr. George Lawson, one and a half.</p>
<p>James Tyson, the well-known Australian millionaire, was born
near Sydney in 1823.&nbsp; His father was the scion of a good old
Cumberland family, but having offended his parents by marriage
against their wishes, he found things so unpleasant at home that
he enlisted in the army.&nbsp; His discharge was purchased in
1818, when he emigrated from England in the service of Mr.
Commissioner Bigge, who was sent out to investigate the charges
against Governor Macquarie.&nbsp; In time, he commenced his
career as a farmer, and died.&nbsp; His son, after assisting his
mother on her farm, entered the service of a firm of
agriculturists, on a salary of &pound;30 a year.&nbsp; Many were
his ups and downs.&nbsp; At one time he had to go to a station
for a draft of cattle, which were to be placed under the care of
himself and brother.&nbsp; James Tyson, to prepare himself for
his journey, cooked as many rations as he could carry on his
horse, and of money he had just one shilling, which was demanded
of him by the ferryman for taking him with his horse over the
Murrumbidgee.&nbsp; Declining to part with his shilling, he swam
over the river, if not at the risk of his life, greatly to the
detriment of his rations.&nbsp; Again, we <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>find him in
another part of the colony, where, while his brother kept a
dairy, James went jobbing and cattle-driving, until a few of his
cattle were fat, and fit for market.&nbsp; He afterwards, with
the neighbouring stock-owners, sold a lot at Sydney.&nbsp; He and
his brother, in time, obtained possession of a run near the
junction of the Lachland and Murrumbidgee rivers.&nbsp; In 1851,
when the gold discoveries were made, James Tyson commenced
cattle-driving to Sandhurst, where he opened up a large business
as a butcher, wholesale and retail, and where he made a good deal
of money.&nbsp; After carrying on business successfully till
1855, he made some purchases of stations, and next extended his
operations to Queensland.&nbsp; He afterwards acquired several
immense stations on the Warrego, where, as in Victoria and New
South Wales, he now holds large areas of freehold land.&nbsp; His
mother is naturally very proud of her distinguished son.&nbsp;
When the Duke of Edinburgh was in the colony he was taken to see
the old lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said the old woman, as
the Prince bade her good-bye, &lsquo;you can tell your mother you
have shaken hands with Jem Tyson&rsquo;s mother,&rsquo; and no
doubt the message was faithfully reported.</p>
<p>Mr. Tyson is a broad-shouldered, robust man, standing 6 feet
3&frac12; inches high.&nbsp; He has never had a <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>day&rsquo;s
illness in his life; has lived much in the open air, and prefers
it; is a keen sportsman, and a good shot.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he
is a good deal of a vegetarian.&nbsp; On one occasion, it is
said, according to the custom of the country, in the course of
his travels he rode up to a station for a night&rsquo;s
lodging.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, is that you?&rsquo; said the woman of
the house.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can go and hobble yourself,&rsquo;
throwing him the leathern straps by means of which the Australian
colonists hobble their horses for the night.&nbsp; The
millionaire is reported often to indulge in an economical supper
of boiled grass, and hence the woman&rsquo;s allusion.&nbsp; A
stricter teetotaler there is not in Australia.&nbsp; Mr. Tyson
has never indulged in a glass of wine or spirits in his life, nor
has he ever smoked an ounce of tobacco.&nbsp; It is to be
questioned whether he would have had such a successful career as
he has marked out for himself, had he indulged in the drinking
customs which were the disgrace of all Australia at one
time.&nbsp; He owes his good fortune almost entirely to his
energy, his untiring industry, and his great self-denial.&nbsp;
He is a true friend and a staunch protector of the aborigines on
his various stations, who are all much attached to him, and
render willing service.&nbsp; He is of a very retiring
disposition, and has always refused to allow parliamentary or any
other public honours to be <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>thrust upon him.&nbsp; He is a
bachelor, and mingles but little in society&mdash;is, however,
very fond of children, and has always been a liberal supporter of
all local schools and other popular institutions, though
generally averse to having his name paraded before the
public.&nbsp; The exact amount of his wealth is not known, but he
is supposed to have amassed from four to six millions, and, on
one occasion, he offered the Government of Queensland the loan of
half a million towards the construction of a trans-continental
railway.&nbsp; Those who know him best, say of him as Disraeli
said of Gladstone, &lsquo;He has not one redeeming
vice.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is to his credit that his temper is so even
that, under the most trying circumstances, no profane word has
ever been heard to escape from his lips.&nbsp; On one occasion,
riding late at night to one of his many stations, he was refused
admission by the keeper, to whom he told his name in vain, as the
man did not believe him.&nbsp; He slept out that night, and, when
he returned in the morning, rewarded the man handsomely for his
obedience to orders.&nbsp; Of course Mr. Tyson is not very
popular.&nbsp; He is too wealthy to be that.&nbsp; Impecunious
people always make a dead set at a millionaire, and are very
wrath if he does not see his way to set them on their legs again,
or, at any rate, to give them a start in life.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
simplicity <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>and frugality of his habits,&rsquo; observes Mr.
Henniker-Heaton, M.P., from whom I borrow most of the particulars
of this sketch, &lsquo;should disarm the envy of those who might
be disposed to covet his great riches.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alas! the
reverse is the case.&nbsp; I found few who had a good word to say
of the richest man in any of the Australian colonies, and all
sorts of wild stories are told of him&mdash;even as to his
exploits when in a state of alleged drunkenness.&nbsp; Mr. Tyson
has, at any rate, one fault, and that is he is a very great hater
of women; he even dislikes, I was told, to employ married
men.&nbsp; &lsquo;He sees no good in having a man who is under
the influence of a woman.&rsquo;&nbsp; Clearly he holds that no
man can serve two masters.&nbsp; Poor fellow!&nbsp; I asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is to become of all his wealth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will help to make work for the lawyers,&rsquo; was
the somewhat cynical reply.</p>
<p>We admire Mr. Tyson for his abstinence, and for his energy,
his industry, and economy.&nbsp; In this respect he sets the
Australians a good example, but he is not a model to be followed
in every respect.&nbsp; The best of us, it is to be feared, are
poor creatures after all.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">AUSTRALIAN FACTS AND FIGURES.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Increase of the Colonies&mdash;Further
Emigration Required&mdash;New South Wales and
Free-trade&mdash;The Australian Type.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Statistics</span> are not pleasant
reading.&nbsp; They are so easily twisted to serve the
writer&rsquo;s purpose rather than to develop the real truth of
the case, but to please certain readers who are always wanting to
know, I give the Australasian statistics for 1888 laid before the
New South Wales Parliament, which show another year of steady
progress on the part of these colonies.&nbsp; The total
population of Australasia on December 31 last is estimated at
3,672,803, Victoria standing highest with 1,090,869; New South
Wales, 1,085,740; New Zealand, 607,380; South Australia, 313,065;
Queensland, 387,463; Tasmania, 146,149; Western Australia,
42,137.&nbsp; The total increase for the year was 126,077, the
Queensland ratio of increase being 5.59; Victoria, 5.28; New
South Wales, 4.10; Tasmania, <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>2.57; New Zealand, .66; South
Australia, .21; while Western Australia showed a decrease of 351
persons, or .82 per cent.&nbsp; There was a total of 26,584
marriages, 122,982 births, and 48,400 deaths last year; the
average birth-rate per 1,000 being 34.05, and death-rate
13.40.&nbsp; The number of immigrants and emigrants during the
year was respectively 24,889 and 188,230, the excess of emigrants
being 65,599.&nbsp; The Victorian net gain by immigration was
41,803; that of New South Wales, 21,545; Queensland, 11,805;
whilst in South Australia there were 113 less immigrants than
emigrants, Western Australia being on the same side of the
balance to the extent of 1,196, and New Zealand to the extent of
9,175.&nbsp; Of sheep the Australian Colonies possess
96,487,811.&nbsp; Of these New South Wales has 48.20 per cent.;
Victoria, 11.20; Queensland, 13.93; South Australia, 7.41.&nbsp;
Horned cattle, total 9,248,949, New South Wales possessing 17.54
percent.; Victoria, 14.19; Queensland, 50.32; South Australia,
4.65.&nbsp; Horses amount to 1,136,683, New South Wales having
21.88 per cent.; Victoria, 21.31; Queensland, 607; South
Australia, 14.95.&nbsp; The imports for the colonies in 1888
were: New South Wales, &pound;20,885,557; Victoria,
&pound;23,972,134; South Australia, &pound;5,413,638; Queensland,
&pound;6,544,324.&nbsp; Exports: New South Wales,
&pound;20,859,715; Victoria, <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>&pound;13, 853,763; South Australia,
&pound;6,984,098; Queensland, &pound;5,226,929.&nbsp; Total
imports and exports for the whole of the colonies,
&pound;121,859,908, or &pound;33 15s. 2d. per head.&nbsp; New
South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia
exceeded this average, whilst the other colonies were
considerably below it.&nbsp; The total tonnage entered and
cleared at Australian ports amounted to 14,689,766 tons, of which
New South Wales represented 4,765,419 tons; Victoria, 4,307,883
tons; South Australia, 1,973,651 tons.</p>
<p>In answer to the question why Australia does not attract a far
larger European emigration, the reply is, the mistaken policy of
the Australian Parliament.&nbsp; The working man in Australia is
opposed to it, and M.P.&rsquo;s truckle to his wishes.&nbsp; An
Australian M.P. is paid, and he naturally wishes to retain his
pay, and hence he bows to the majority, whether right or
wrong.&nbsp; If English emigrants went to Australia, as they do
to Canada or America, the Australian colonies would flourish,
labour would be cheap, agriculture would prosper, and the
railways would be filled with passengers whose payments would
enable them to yield good dividends.&nbsp; Mr. Macfie, a
gentleman who resided ten years in Australia, and who is a master
of Australian statistics, in a paper read before the Royal
Colonial Society last year, <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>contended that the most urgently
needed aid to Australian development is selecting British and
European population suitable for settlement on the land, and for
raising productions for which there is a large demand in the
colonies, the United Kingdom, and in foreign countries.&nbsp;
Under the present system of government, this seems to be quite
out of the question.&nbsp; He describes, for instance, the
operatives of Victoria as organized into a compact phalanx under
leaders who have succeeded by dogged persistence in imbuing the
colony with the notion that they constitute the party which
controls the voting power at elections.&nbsp; &lsquo;So
widely,&rsquo; says Mr. Macfie, &lsquo;is this assumption
believed, that candidates for the Legislative Assembly, to whom a
Parliamentary salary or political influence is a consideration,
defer with real or affected humility to the wishes of the Trades
Hall Council of Melbourne.&nbsp; The inevitable outcome of this
state of political subjection on the part of members of the
House, and in many cases of the Government also, is the injustice
of class legislation.&nbsp; On the unjustifiable plea that the
tendency of emigration is to reduce the rate of wages in the
colony, the working-classes make no secret of their determination
that the Government shall be prohibited from taking steps to
encourage immigration of any kind, or even to <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>diffuse
information systematically, by pamphlets and lectures throughout
Europe, in localities where thousands are thirsting to learn
about Australia, and who would gladly proceed thither at their
own cost, and engage in profitable branches of land
culture.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is really discouraging to find that
while the Argentine Confederation receives an addition to its
population on an average of 7,000 a week, and the United States
10,000, Australia, with its splendid climate and other
advantages, only attracts a little over 1,000 persons, old and
young, male and female, per week.&nbsp; This state of things is
mischievous in many ways.&nbsp; It is not pleasant to find that,
as Mr. Herbert Tritton pointed out, the Australasian Government
debts increase in a very much larger ratio than the
population.&nbsp; On this head Mr. Macfie makes a rather alarming
statement.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;recently
been informed that a large investor in Australasian securities,
deeply impressed with the necessity of investigating this subject
for himself, proceeded to Australasia for the purpose of doing
so.&nbsp; He returned to England convinced that in most of the
self-governing colonies the working classes were barring the door
against any effort whatsoever being made to promote immigration,
extend widely agricultural settlement, and thus develop export
wealth to Europe and America.&nbsp; He arrived at <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>the
conclusion that there was a tendency in the Local Governments and
Parliaments to pander to the prejudices of those who
indiscriminately discourage the introduction of even desirable
immigrants.&nbsp; The belief was forced upon him that it is no
sufficient answer to the fears of the bondholders to say that the
money lent by them goes into reproductive works, such as
railways.&nbsp; He saw railways constructed to serve an extremely
sparse population in country districts, instead of a population
twenty times the size, which would have rendered the line
proportionately remunerative, had as much care been taken to
attract people from Europe as to obtain British capital to build
new lines for the limited number of settlers established in the
districts through which they pass.&nbsp; The result of that
visitor&rsquo;s observation was that he sold out&mdash;I think,
with unwarrantable haste&mdash;his interest in Australasian
stocks on his return home.&nbsp; Whether his views are correct or
erroneous is not the question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The one colony that seems to flourish most is New South Wales,
under a system of Free Trade, which, however, I fear is losing
its popularity every day.&nbsp; &lsquo;Compared with the other
colonies,&rsquo; said Sir Henry Parkes, when I was
there&mdash;&lsquo;the only statesman in the colonies,&rsquo;
observed a gentleman to me one day&mdash;the <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>popular
Premier of New South Wales, &lsquo;New South Wales was the
oldest, the richest and the most powerful.&nbsp; Ten or twelve
years ago Victoria was far in advance of this colony&mdash;a
quarter of a million of population in advance of us; but now we
were in advance of her, and intended to keep in advance of
her.&nbsp; In no other country in the world,&rsquo; said Sir
Henry, &lsquo;had anyone a chance of making a fortune as he had
in New South Wales, and yet how melancholy is the spectacle, only
peopled, as it were, on the fringe, with cities congested, while
the land remained untilled; with all Europe waiting to buy if the
colonies would but attract people to settle on its vacant lands
and till its soil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Naturally you ask whether there is arising a distinct type of
Australian.&nbsp; I think there is.&nbsp; The young Australian is
tall, dark, has high cheek-bones and prominent teeth.&nbsp; Dr.
MacLaurin, who lived a long time in Australia, and who is able to
form a better opinion on the subject, in a paper read before the
British Association, says in New South Wales and in Tasmania
three generations have been exposed to the new conditions, and
the greatgrandchildren of the first settlers cannot be
distinguished from Englishmen, Scotchmen, or Irishmen, by
anything in &lsquo;configuration and type.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is
no essentially <i>Australian</i> type of <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>man.&nbsp;
It is true that we find a certain &lsquo;sallowness in
complexion&rsquo; among the inhabitants of the colonies, but this
may be observed also among those who have been only a few years
resident there.&nbsp; It is due, Dr. MacLaurin thinks, much more
to the effects of the sun&rsquo;s rays on the skin than to any
<i>an&aelig;mia</i> arising from climate.&nbsp; The alleged
&lsquo;lankiness&rsquo; of the Australians is also very much a
myth.&nbsp; Dr. MacLaurin can find no trace of it, after twenty
years of experience in connection with assurance society
examinations.&nbsp; He thinks, if it exists at all, it is only
during the period of youth, when growth goes on more rapidly and
under healthier conditions than in Europe.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fact
is, the Australian youth are, as a whole, better fed, better
clad, and better lodged than the inhabitants of Europe.&nbsp;
They are not so much exposed to the inclemencies of the weather,
and they are not obliged to work too hard or too
early.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hence the tendency to a &lsquo;tall, active,
and athletic figure.&rsquo;&nbsp; With regard to muscular vigour,
the Australian has proved himself well able to hold his own in
the struggle for existence.&nbsp; If we think only of the great
love of out-door life, of athletic sports, of racing, rowing,
cricketing, and the like, manifested by all native Australians,
we shall come to the conclusion that they certainly are not
deficient in <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>muscular force.&nbsp; Dr. MacLaurin thinks the native
Australian has no need to fear comparison with the youth of the
mother land.&nbsp; The professors in the universities and
colleges assure us that Australians are quite as bright and
capable as the youth in British schools of learning; and
Australian young men who study in Europe are always able to take
a high position in intellectual competitions.&nbsp; Some of them,
indeed, have recently taken the very highest places.&nbsp; When
this subject is studied from the standpoint of longevity and
fertility, we find the same excellent results.&nbsp; It is true
that the deaths among persons over sixty-five years of age are
more numerous here than in England, but every decade the standard
of age is increasing, and when we take the general death-rate, we
find that New South Wales is decidedly healthy as compared with
any part of Great Britain and Ireland.&nbsp; In like manner the
native Australian is as able as anyone to resist disease, which
is only another way of saying that his physique is thoroughly
healthy and capable of great endurance.</p>
<p>People at home have curious ideas as to Australian
distances.&nbsp; I was asked to see a woman employed in some
charitable institution near Sydney.&nbsp; When I got to Sydney,
on asking for that particular locality, I was told it was
seventy-two miles off.</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>One
sees a great many people who enjoy life in Australia who could
not live at home.&nbsp; That is one great charm of a country
which, as has been well remarked, would get on very well if the
inhabitants would grumble less at the climate and dam the rivers
more.</p>
<p>The whites and the blacks do not seem yet to have hit on a
<i>modus vivendi</i>.&nbsp; It is true the savant does not do as
he did in the old times, coolly shoot a black when he wanted to
add a skull to his collection.&nbsp; But while I was in
Queensland a couple of whites did fire on a black, and a black
did kill a white.&nbsp; Under the new constitution to be granted
to Western Australia, the aborigines are to be placed under the
care of a Commissioner, independent of the Parliament, and
responsible only to the Governor.&nbsp; &pound;5,000 a year is to
be devoted to the purpose, but it is not clear how a body without
police organization can watch and protect the inhabitants of a
thousand square miles.&nbsp; I quote a case which occurred to
show how matters are at present.&nbsp; In March last the blacks
near Kimberley speared the horses of a man named Howard.&nbsp;
Whether Howard had given them just cause I am unable to
say.&nbsp; Howard himself evidently thought they were the
aggressors, as he, with the assistance of a constable, followed
them, and <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>shot some three or four.&nbsp; The affair came to the
ears of justice, and Howard and the constable were put on their
trial for murder.&nbsp; They were acquitted, of course, owing to
the absence of direct proof that any lives were actually taken,
and owing to the doubts that existed as to whether they simply
fired at the blacks on coming up to them, or resorted to arms in
self-defence.</p>
<p>The forests want looking after.&nbsp; In New South Wales,
Victoria, New Zealand, and South Australia, the Governments are
growing alive to the fact that the forests cannot last for
ever.&nbsp; In many districts the traveller passes through
hundreds of miles of ring-barked country, very desolate to look
upon.&nbsp; It is pleasant to note that in some quarters steps
have been taken to find a remedy.&nbsp; Especially is this the
case in South Australia.&nbsp; Last year as many as 40,000 trees
were sent out from the State nursery for planting.</p>
<p>The land question gives a good deal of trouble.&nbsp; It has,
in New South Wales, much to answer for, as the great want of the
farmer is water, and he will not improve his property by sinking
Artesian wells, at a cost of &pound; 1,000 each, unless he has a
better title.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is held that Victorian
prosperity is chiefly due to its liberal land laws.&nbsp; In New
South <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>Wales the farmer is given 2,500 acres with no
cultivation conditions.&nbsp; He can hold it as he gets it till
his time is up, and transfer it to the squatter, and then go and
re-select as long and as often as he likes, with this result,
that there is no real settlement in the land&mdash;no progress,
and no employment for the agricultural labourer.</p>

Tea&mdash;Stoppage in the Canal&mdash;Tilbury Docks&mdash;The
Future of Australia&mdash;Australia as a Field for
Emigration.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> more I am afloat.&nbsp; I bid
good-bye to a friend who was six months coming out, and lived on
salt beef and pork all the while.&nbsp; In this respect we have
changed for the better.&nbsp; But the sea, is it ever to be
depended on?</p>
<p>According to the Duc de Joinville, when Saint Louis, King of
France, was on his return journey from the Holy Land, whither he
had been to fight the Saracen, off Cyprus the ship ran aground,
and all were in deadly peril.&nbsp; But the King refused to get
into another ship, preferring, he tells us, &lsquo;to entrust to
God&rsquo;s keeping my own life and the lives of my wife and
children, rather than ensure so much hurt to such a large number
of persons as are on <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>board.&rsquo;&nbsp; Few of us have
attained to such saintship, and, as a matter of fact, as regards
most of us, our trust in supernatural interposition is that of
the old woman of whom Mr. Gough used to tell us who, when asked
how she felt when the horse ran away, replied that she trusted in
Providence till the reins broke, and then she gave up.&nbsp;
Alas, in a stormy sea, in a moment of peril from collision, or in
case of a ship foundering, in the mad struggle for life it seems
as if, in spite of all science has yet achieved, as if there were
no power, human or divine, to ward off that cruel death, which in
that hour of agony seems to ride the whirlwind and direct the
storm; and day by day, and now more than ever, we hear of
tragedies at sea which make the cheek of the landsman, even if he
has no loved ones to lament, turn pale, and his heart to
sicken.&nbsp; It is true ships carry boats, but they are smashed
in launching, or they are launched too late, or they are upset;
or if not, they carry no provisions, or are found deficient in
oars, and the chances are if help comes in the shape of a
friendly ship that has seen the signal from afar, only a few
survive to tell the sad tale of cold and wet and hunger and
thirst, under the fearful pressure of which their shipmates have
succumbed.&nbsp; In the House of Commons, the other day, an M.P.
suggested that <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>an Act of Parliament should be passed compelling every
ship to carry as many boats as would accommodate all the crew and
passengers&mdash;an utter impossibility.&nbsp; Clearly it is not
in that direction that we are to look for help.&nbsp; It consoles
one to reflect, however, that the commanders and officers of our
Australian steamers rarely run their ships into danger, and
manage when in it to get out again.</p>
<p>It is in the dark watches of the night that a passenger feels
most timid.&nbsp; A lady assured me, the other day, whenever it
was rough she lay awake all night expecting the ship to go to the
bottom.&nbsp; I endeavoured to give her what comfort I could; but
night in the tropics is slightly awful.&nbsp; The sun drops down
into the waters in such a glare of angry red.&nbsp; The clouds
that come, or rather fly, with the early dawn seem so dark and
threatening, and then the ocean has ever a melancholy wail.&nbsp;
These almost leave me sometimes absolutely awestruck.&nbsp; It is
not in this case true that familiarity breeds contempt.</p>
<p>At length I lay down my pen so far as the great country of
Australia is concerned.&nbsp; I have skirted its coast for many a
hundred miles.&nbsp; I have tarried in its cities, have seen some
of its best men and women, and have gone up into the interior,
where population is scarce and life is of the simplest and <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>roughest.&nbsp; I came back by the dear old
<i>Liguria</i> from Sydney to Melbourne, was carried by the
<i>Austral</i> to Adelaide, and then left Adelaide by the
<i>Iberia</i>, &lsquo;the best ship of the line,&rsquo; said an
old Australian to me, with a captain, whose name is Shannon, as
fond of a good game of chess as myself, and who did much to make
me and all his passengers comfortable.&nbsp; The <i>Iberia</i> is
not such a grand ship as the <i>Orizaba</i>, and its smoking-room
was uncomfortably small, but we managed to enjoy ourselves after
we had left Cape Leeuwin, always washed by a stormy sea, and
found ourselves once more on the Indian Ocean, calm all the way
as a mill-pond, but hot as a furnace in full blast.&nbsp; What a
relief it was to see Adam&rsquo;s Peak, and green Ceylon, and
Colombo; to exchange my warm clothing for the white suit of
clothing the Cingalese tailor makes up for you while the ship is
coaling, and to go on shore and take a ride along the parks and
flower-gardens and cocoanut-groves of the gem of the Indian
Ocean, as Colombo is fitly called!&nbsp; On my return I was
exceptionally fortunate.&nbsp; Mr. John Fergusson, of the
<i>Colombo Observer</i>, had seen my name in the list of
passengers, and, with a kindness for which I cannot be too
grateful, had sent a native messenger on board to take me on
shore&mdash;a brown, slightly-dressed young gentleman, whose
broken <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>English helped at any rate to while away the time, and
to make me forget the awful heat.&nbsp; Mr. Fergusson, after a
warm reception&mdash;all the more agreeable as up to that time I
had not even known his name&mdash;being an editor and too busy to
give me much of his time, handed me over to the care of his
pastor, the Rev. Mr. Durbin, a Baptist minister, whose chapel is
one of the most attractive places of worship in the town, and
whose congregation, I found, was in a very flourishing
condition.&nbsp; In company with this gentleman, I inspected the
oldest ecclesiastical building at Colombo, the old Dutch church,
built much after the fashion that prevails in Holland to this
day.&nbsp; Then we did the Law Courts, a pile of white buildings,
forming a perfect square, crowded all day long with natives, who
are never so happy as when at law with each other.&nbsp; The
courts were lofty and airy, and the crowd of half-dressed
witnesses and criminals were kept at a respectful distance.&nbsp;
The proceedings were somewhat slow, as the evidence had to be
translated into English for the benefit of the presiding
genius.&nbsp; Native police guarded both the exterior and
interior, and in the library I was introduced to several native
barristers&mdash;very fine, manly-looking men&mdash;whose manners
and appearance were of the most unexceptionable character.&nbsp;
<a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>In
company with Mrs. Fergusson, I visited the far-famed Arabi Pasha,
in his picturesque place of exile&mdash;a well-made Egyptian, in
the dress of his country, who received us politely, but the
conversation we carried on was not of very thrilling
character.&nbsp; The gentleman is shy of interviewers.&nbsp; A
correspondent one day had called on him, and to his disgust the
whole conversation was related in a London newspaper.&nbsp;
Consequently, now, Arabi says little, though, perhaps, he thinks
the more.&nbsp; One of our party had taken Mr. Caine, when in
Colombo, to call, but the English M.P. failed to get much out of
the wily Egyptian, though he tried him in every possible
way.&nbsp; Nor was Arabi much more communicative to myself.&nbsp;
He seemed to me weary of his exile.&nbsp; Indeed, he told me he
would prefer London to Colombo.&nbsp; &lsquo;He ought not to
dislike the English,&rsquo; said a resident in Suez to me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He would have been murdered had he stopped there.&nbsp; He
has no friends in Egypt; the Egyptians always kick a man when he
is down.&rsquo;&nbsp; I returned to the <i>Iberia</i> in a
catamaran, and with a box of the finest Ceylon tea, kindly given
me by Mr. Fergusson, and which, for the benefit of my home
readers, I may mention may be procured of Messrs. Swan, Laurence
Pountney Lane, London, dealers in Ceylon tea exclusively.</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>We
had the usual fine, hot weather up the Red Sea.&nbsp; I had a
disagreeable attack of what is called prickly heat&mdash;the only
consolation, and it was a real one, being that the weather-wise
assured me that if I had not had it, I should have had something
worse.&nbsp; We did not call at Aden, nor were we sorry for that,
as most of us had got rather tired of the long travel and
exhausting heat.&nbsp; Already we had had three deaths on board,
and were eager to be safe at home.&nbsp; One morning the captain
pointed to our left, and told me that on one of the islands far
away in that direction the woman is master, and the man has to
take the back-seat.&nbsp; It would have been interesting if we
could have gone there and seen how they got on, but mail steamers
are bound to keep on their proper course.&nbsp; He who would
study the islands and waste places of the Indian Ocean must have
a yacht to himself&mdash;and there is a good deal to be learned,
which can be got at in no other way.&nbsp; In due time we were in
the Canal&mdash;alas! there to remain all night at anchor, with
the lights of old Suez in the distance, which we were afraid to
visit, as we might be off at any moment.&nbsp; The Egyptians,
with their donkeys on the beach, all night long screamed to us to
come on shore and have a ride.&nbsp; At length, the <i>Katie</i>,
of West Hartlepool, which had grounded and stopped our passage,
was <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>got
off, and we made our way to Port Said, which did not prove more
attractive on a second visit than it did on the first.&nbsp; Of
course I went on shore to look at the veiled women and bearded
men, to be attacked by the sellers of cigars and rubbish of all
kinds, and to get very tired of the place, which, however, must
do a good deal of business in the course of the year.</p>
<p>Cooler weather comes to us as we sail through the Straits of
Messina, and pass snow-capped Etna afar off.&nbsp; We stop at
Naples to set down the mails and take up passengers.&nbsp; We are
full to suffocation.&nbsp; My cabin, too small for myself to live
in in comfort, has to submit to intrusion: but old gentlemen who
have been spending the winter abroad with their wives and
families have to be accommodated.</p>
<p>At Gibraltar we stop to take up a few more passengers, and to
buy Spanish fans and Moorish trifles.&nbsp; It really does strike
one how, as you approach the Rock from the Mediterranean, it
resembles a huge lion, with its back on Africa, and its face
looking towards Spain.&nbsp; In the Bay of Biscay there is what
the meteorologists call a slight depression, which means a little
rolling; all that we have had to encounter since we left Cape
Leeuwin.&nbsp; The rolling, more or less, accompanies us to
Plymouth, where we <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>arrive at night.&nbsp; The knowing ones get out, and
proceed to London by train, as they say we shall catch it in the
Channel.&nbsp; As usual, the knowing ones are wrong.&nbsp; Who
but a fool will talk with certainty about horses, wine, women, or
weather?&nbsp; It is fine, beautifully fine, till we get to Deal,
when down come the heavens in waterfalls of rain.&nbsp; It rains
all night as we lie at anchor there, waiting for the daylight to
take us to Tilbury Docks, to be examined by Custom House officers
in the huge shed where all the luggage is landed, and the
Queen&rsquo;s taxes paid.&nbsp; This is a place where a passenger
need have sharp eyes.&nbsp; I found, after a good deal of
trouble, a beautiful fur rug, which happened to be mine, in a
place where it had no right to be.&nbsp; It is hard on the
passenger, that Custom House shed, and by the time the poor
fellow is shot out at Fenchurch Street, where he has to seek his
scattered luggage at the hazard of his life, it is not much to be
wondered at if he resolves never to take an Australian trip
again.</p>
<p>I must own, however, that no such feeling entered into my
head.&nbsp; The difficulties which at one time beset the
traveller are unknown.&nbsp; He is at home among friends.&nbsp;
It is said the last of the Australian Bush Rangers now keeps an
hotel in San Francisco, so there is little to fear.&nbsp; My
experiences in Australia <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>remain in my memory, and will long
remain, as among the brightest and pleasantest of a life
mercifully varied and protracted more than that of many.&nbsp; I
have seen a sunny land, rich in all that men hold dear, where our
brethren have planted another Britain&mdash;minus the State
Church, in which few of us believe, and the aristocratic element,
which all the world over has had its day.&nbsp; Democracy has
grown to be the ruler of the world, and in Australia the
experiment, so far as it has been tried, is a success.&nbsp;
Material wealth abounds, and statesmen have provided that
ignorance shall be banished the new community; while the
religious of all denominations have shown how churches are to be
built and preachers provided, and Christ&rsquo;s kingdom advanced
better without a State Church than with it.&nbsp; In many parts,
especially in Adelaide, I was the recipient of a graceful and
lavish hospitality impossible to conceive of at home.&nbsp;
There, also, I found a civilization as refined, an energy it may
be greater, a hope&mdash;as regards this world, at any
rate&mdash;more secure.&nbsp; If we have to mourn over a Paradise
Lost, in Australia we realize a Paradise Regained.&nbsp; Of the
Australian, I may emphatically say that his lines are cast in
pleasant places, and that he has a goodly heritage.&nbsp; Whether
he will long remain a colonist I more than doubt.&nbsp; The
colonies, I hold, <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>are prepared for separation; but, when it does come, it
will be not from choice, but necessity.&nbsp; So long as no
practical difficulties arise, matters will remain as they
are.</p>
<p>Is Australia a fitting field for emigration?&nbsp; Will it
provide our starving East-enders with good living and good
homes?&nbsp; And can the young man of the middle-class find there
the opening for his energies denied him here?&nbsp; The last
question I am rather inclined to answer in the
affirmative&mdash;if he has his head on his shoulders&mdash;if he
does not rate his own services too highly&mdash;if he does not
refuse the first opportunity that comes in his way.&nbsp; Friends
he will find in the colony ready to lend him a helping hand, and
in most of the towns there is a branch of the Christian Young
Men&rsquo;s Association, the secretary of which is generally in a
position to give him suitable advice.&nbsp; It is a fact that
people do well as a rule, and that, thanks to the climate, the
tender-chested and delicate have a better prospect of healthy
life than in our damp and fog-crowned island.&nbsp; In a land
flooded with glorious sunshine, poverty loses some of its
bitterness, for in Australia the blue sky and the bright sun are
the heritage of all.&nbsp; As to our very poor&mdash;whom we
gladly ship off&mdash;as a rule I question whether they would be
much benefited by being shot <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>out into the poor quarters of the
great Australian towns and cities.&nbsp; They are too feeble to
stand alone.&nbsp; There is no help for them as long as they
breed as awfully as they do at the East End.&nbsp; Charity seeks
to supply their needs in vain, and as to State interference, the
less we have of that the better.&nbsp; The strong, self-reliant,
clear-headed working-man&mdash;the man who can get on at
home&mdash;will get on out there; as will also the capitalist who
knows how to invest his money.&nbsp; A man who is in a good
position at home, however, would be a fool to throw it up for the
sake of a chance in the land of the Golden Fleece.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
